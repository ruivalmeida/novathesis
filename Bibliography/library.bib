abstract = {AIM: To agree a draft pressure ulcer risk factor Minimum Data Set to underpin the development of a new evidenced-based Risk Assessment Framework. BACKGROUND: A recent systematic review identified the need for a pressure ulcer risk factor Minimum Data Set and development and validation of an evidenced-based pressure ulcer Risk Assessment Framework. This was undertaken through the Pressure UlceR Programme Of reSEarch (RP-PG-0407-10056), funded by the National Institute for Health Research and incorporates five phases. This article reports phase two, a consensus study. DESIGN: Consensus study. METHOD: A modified nominal group technique based on the Research and Development/University of California at Los Angeles appropriateness method. This incorporated an expert group, review of the evidence and the views of a Patient and Public Involvement service user group. Data were collected December 2010–December 2011. FINDINGS: The risk factors and assessment items of the Minimum Data Set (including immobility, pressure ulcer and skin status, perfusion, diabetes, skin moisture, sensory perception and nutrition) were agreed. In addition, a draft Risk Assessment Framework incorporating all Minimum Data Set items was developed, comprising a two stage assessment process (screening and detailed full assessment) and decision pathways. CONCLUSION: The draft Risk Assessment Framework will undergo further design and pre-testing with clinical nurses to assess and improve its usability. It will then be evaluated in clinical practice to assess its validity and reliability. The Minimum Data Set could be used in future for large scale risk factor studies informing refinement of the Risk Assessment Framework. },

abstract = {GAME(Wheels) is an interface between a portable roller system and a computer that enables a wheelchair user to play commercially available computer video games. The subject controls the game play with the propulsion of their wheelchair's wheels on the rollers. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether using the GAME(Wheels) System during wheelchair propulsion exercise can help increase the individual's physiological response and aid in the motivation to exercise. Fifteen subjects participated in this study. The subjects propelled their wheelchairs on a portable roller that was equipped with the GAME(Wheels) System. There were two exercise trials consisting of 2 min of warm-up, 16 min of exercise and 2 min of cool-down. Physiological data (ventilation rate, oxygen consumption, heart rate) were collected. A significant difference (P{\textless}0.05) was found between exercise with GAME(Wheels) versus without GAME(Wheels) for average ventilation rate and average oxygen consumption. The differences were found during time periods of transition from warm-up to exercise, and before and after the midpoint of exercise. Written questionnaires showed that 87{\%} of the individuals tested reported the system would help them work out on a regular basis. Playing the video game helped these individuals to reach their exercise training zone faster and maintain it for the entire exercise trial.},

DESIGN: Case study, pre- and postexercise. SETTING: University hospital outpatient clinic. PARTICIPANTS: A young adult with excised cerebellar tumor, 1 middle-aged adult with single right cerebrovascular accident, and 1 middle-aged adult with traumatic brain injury. INTERVENTION: A COP-controlled, video game-based exercise system. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The following were calculated during 12 different tasks: the number of falls, range of COP excursion, and COP path length. RESULTS: Postexercise, subjects exhibited a lower fall count, decreased COP excursion limits for some tasks, increased practice volume, and increased attention span during training. CONCLUSIONS: The COP-controlled video game-based exercise regime motivated subjects to increase their practice volume and attention span during training. This in turn improved subjects' dynamic balance control.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers are one of the most underrated conditions in critically ill patients. Despite the introduction of clinical practice guidelines and advances in medical technology, the prevalence of pressure ulcers in hospitalized patients continues to escalate. Currently, consensus is lacking on the most important risk factors for pressure ulcers in critically ill patients, and no risk assessment scale exclusively for pressure ulcers in these patients is available. OBJECTIVE: To determine which risk factors are most predictive of pressure ulcers in adult critical care patients. Risk factors investigated included total score on the Braden Scale, mobility, activity, sensory perception, moisture, friction/shear, nutrition, age, blood pressure, length of stay in the intensive care unit, score on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, vasopressor administration, and comorbid conditions. METHODS: A retrospective, correlational design was used to examine 347 patients admitted to a medical-surgical intensive care unit from October 2008 through May 2009. RESULTS: According to direct logistic regression analyses, age, length of stay, mobility, friction/shear, norepinephrine infusion, and cardiovascular disease explained a major part of the variance in pressure ulcers. CONCLUSION: Current risk assessment scales for development of pressure ulcers may not include risk factors common in critically ill adults. Development of a risk assessment model for pressure ulcers in these patients is warranted and could be the foundation for development of a risk assessment tool.},

abstract = {This paper presents a prototype kinematic and audio feedback based video game, availing of a scalable motion capture acquisition system, based around a number of orientation sensors. The orientation sensors used are USB based tri-axis magnetic and gravitational field transducers. The novel video-game is capable of incorporating the real time data from these sensors to control an on screen avatar, which in turn can be programmed to give appropriate instructions to the user i.e. play a sound file, once the user obtains a certain posture. The video game is designed to promote physical exercise and movement based relaxation, in particular; yoga. In addition, design considerations; implementation and performance of the system are analyzed, discussed and the accuracy qualitatively analyzed by comparing movement data obtained from it to that of a validated motion analysis technique, the CODA motion analysis system.},

Children (n = 105) were randomly assigned to intervention with either SOT or VRWii, while another 50 served as controls. All children were assessed with measures of sensorimotor functions. At post-intervention, the treatment groups significantly outperformed the control group on all measures. Participants in the VRWii group had a greater pre-post change on motor proficiency, visual-integrative abilities, and sensory integrative functioning. Virtual reality using Wii gaming technology demonstrated benefit in improving sensorimotor functions among children with DS. It could be used as adjuvant therapy to other proven successful rehabilitative interventions in treating children with DS.},

abstract = {Based on parameters governing promoter activity and using regulatory elements of the lac, ara and tet operon transcription control sequences were composed which permit the regulation in Escherichia coli of several gene activities independently and quantitatively. The novel promoter PLtetO-1 allows the regulation of gene expression over an up to 5000-fold range with anhydrotetracycline (aTc) whereas with IPTG and arabinose the activity of Plac/ara-1 may be controlled 1800-fold. Escherichia coli host strains which produce defined amounts of the regulatory proteins, Lac and Tet repressor as well as AraC from chromosomally located expression units provide highly reproducible in vivo conditions. Controlling the expression of the genes encoding luciferase, the low abundance E.coli protein DnaJ and restriction endonuclease Cfr9I not only demonstrates that high levels of expression can be achieved but also suggests that under conditions of optimal repression only around one mRNA every 3rd generation is produced. This potential of quantitative control will open up new approaches in the study of gene function in vivo, in particular with low abundance regulatory gene products. The system will also provide new opportunities for the controlled expression of heterologous genes.},

abstract = {The interface pressure is currently the only clinical tool to estimate the risk of sitting-related pressure ulcers. However, it provides little information on the loading condition in deep tissues. We present a comprehensive 3-D finite element (FE) model for human buttocks with the consideration of the joint configuration and realistic boundary conditions in a sitting posture. Sitting induced soft tissue deformation, internal pressure, and von-Mises stress were computed. The FE model was well validated qualitatively using actual displacement obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. FE analysis demonstrated that the deformation induced by sitting pressure was substantially different among muscle, fat, and skin. The deformation of the muscle varied with location and the maximum was seen in the regions underneath the bony prominence of ischial tuberosity. In these regions, the range of compressive pressure was 65-80 kPa, 50-60 kPa, and 55-65 kPa, for skin, fat, and muscle, respectively. The von-Mises stress distribution had a similar pattern. In conclusion, this study suggests a new methodology for the development and validation of FE models for investigating the risk of sitting-related soft tissue injury. The proposed model may provide researchers and therapists with a powerful technique for evaluating the effectiveness of various postural modulations in preventing deep tissue ulcers.},

Moreover, there are many traditional methods to address RAOS, but few have been adapted and validated for use in the construction industry, thus producing poor results. The contribution of this dissertation is a qualitative fuzzy RAOS model, tailored for the construction industry, named QRAM (Qualitative Risk Assessment Model). QRAM is based on four dimensions: Safety Climate Adequacy, (work accidents) Severity Factors, (work accidents) Possibility Factors and Safety Barriers Effectiveness. The risk assessment is based on real data collected by observation of reality, interviews with workers, foreman and engineers and consultation of site documents (working procedures, reports of work accident investigation, etc.), avoiding the use of data obtained by statistical tecnhiques. To rating each parameter it was defined qualitative evaluators - linguistic variables - which allow to perform a user-friendly knowledge elicitation. QRAM was, firstly evaluated by “peer” review, with 12 safety experts from Brazil (2), Bulgaria (1), Greece (3), Turkey (3) and Portugal (3), and then, evaluated by comparing QRAM with other RAOS tecnhiques and methods. The safety experts , concluded that: a) QRAM is a versatile tool for occupational safety risk assessment on construction sites; b) the specific checklists for knowledge elicitation are a good decision aid and, c) the use of linguistic variables is a better way to make the risk assessments process more objective and reliable.},

abstract = {Prolonged and static sitting postures provoke physical inactivity at VDU workplaces and are therefore discussed as risk factors for the musculoskeletal system. Manufacturers have designed specific dynamic office chairs featuring structural elements which promote dynamic sitting and therefore physical activity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of four specific dynamic chairs on erector spinae and trapezius EMG, postures/joint angles and physical activity intensity (PAI) compared to those of a conventional standard office chair. All chairs were fitted with sensors for measurement of the chair parameters (backrest inclination, forward and sideward seat pan inclination), and tested in the laboratory by 10 subjects performing 7 standardized office tasks and by another 12 subjects in the field during their normal office work. Muscle activation revealed no significant differences between the specific dynamic chairs and the reference chair. Analysis of postures/joint angles and PAI revealed only a few differences between the chairs, whereas the tasks performed strongly affected the measured muscle activation, postures and kinematics. The characteristic dynamic elements of each specific chair yielded significant differences in the measured chair parameters, but these characteristics did not appear to affect the sitting dynamics of the subjects performing their office tasks.},

abstract = {The kinetics of transcription initiation in Escherichia coli depend on the duration of two rate-limiting steps, the closed and the open complex formation. In a lac promoter variant, P(lac/ara-1), the kinetics of these steps is controlled by IPTG and arabinose. From in vivo single-RNA measurements, we find that induction affects the mean and normalized variance of the intervals between consecutive RNA productions. Transcript production is sub-Poissonian in all conditions tested. The kinetics of each step is independently controlled by a different inducer. We conclude that the regulatory mechanism of P(lac/ara-1) allows the stochasticity of gene expression to be environment-dependent.},

abstract = {While sitting is a common aggravating factor in low back pain (LBP), the best sitting posture remains unclear. This study investigated the perceptions of 295 physiotherapists in four different European countries on sitting posture. Physiotherapists selected their perceived best sitting posture from a sample of nine options that ranged from slumped to upright sitting, as well as completing the back beliefs questionnaire (BBQ). 85{\%} of physiotherapists selected one of two postures as best, with one posture being selected significantly more frequently than the remainder (p {\textless} 0.05). Interestingly, these two most frequently selected postures were very different from each other. Those who selected the more upright sitting posture had more negative LBP beliefs on the BBQ (p {\textless} 0.05). The choice of best sitting posture also varied between countries (p {\textless} 0.05). Overall, disagreement remains on what constitutes a neutral spine posture, and what is the best sitting posture. Qualitative comments indicated that sitting postures which matched the natural shape of the spine, and appeared comfortable and/or relaxed without excessive muscle tone were often deemed advantageous. Further research on the perceptions of people with LBP on sitting posture are indicated.},

abstract = {Sitting posture predominates in lifestyle and workplace, but quantitative postural designation is limited due to divergence of methodology used in the studies. To date, no study has investigated the upper body's habitual or a predetermined sitting posture in healthy individuals assessing together pelvis, spine and head. The objectives were (i) assessment of intra-rater reliability of positioning subjects to a lordotic sitting posture and (ii) comparison of habitual sitting posture (HSP) with the lordotic posture. Another objective was to synthesize and propose an improved 3D model for pelvis, trunk and head to assess quantitatively the postural sagittal configuration. A single session test-retest design was employed. After power calculations 25 subjects were recruited. A repeated measure ANOVA revealed significant differences between HSP and the predetermined posture used in the study. Intra-rater reliability was analysed used the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and also standard error of measurement (SEM) and smallest real difference (SRD) were calculated. The ICC values for all angles ranged from 0.85 to 0.98 indicating almost perfect agreement. The SEMs for all angles ranged in degrees from 0.65 to 1.50 and the SRDs from 1.80 to 4.16. This study provides the most specific sagittal measurement of surface spinal curves, head and pelvis position, in reference to a lordotic seated posture. The clinical significance of this study is reinforced by the fact that postural assessment is conducted by body surface evaluation. The results regarding reliability and SEMs established that healthy individuals can be reliably positioned in an upright lordotic sitting posture.},

abstract = {To explore the quality/comprehensiveness of nursing documentation of pressure ulcers and to investigate the relationship between the nursing documentation and the incidence of pressure ulcers in four intensive care units. Pressure ulcer prevention requires consistent assessments and documentation to decrease pressure ulcer incidence. Currently, most research is focused on devices to prevent pressure ulcers. Studies have rarely considered the relationship among pressure ulcer risk factors, incidence and nursing documentation. Thus, a study to investigate this relationship is needed to fill this information gap. A retrospective, comparative, descriptive, correlational study. A convenience sample of 196 intensive care units patients at the selected medical centre comprised the study sample. All medical records of patients admitted to intensive care units between the time periods of September 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012 were audited. Data used in the analysis included 98 pressure ulcer patients and 98 non-pressure ulcer patients. The quality and comprehensiveness of pressure ulcer documentation were measured by the modified European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel Pressure Ulcers Assessment Instrument and the Comprehensiveness in Nursing Documentation instrument. The correlations between quality/comprehensiveness of pressure ulcer documentation and incidence of pressure ulcers were not statistically significant. Patients with pressure ulcers had longer length of stay than patients without pressure ulcers stay. There were no statistically significant differences in quality/comprehensiveness scores of pressure ulcer documentation between dayshift and nightshift. This study revealed a lack of quality/comprehensiveness in nursing documentation of pressure ulcers. This study demonstrates that staff nurses often perform poorly on documenting pressure ulcer appearance, staging and treatment. Moreover, nursing documentation of pressure ulcers does not provide a complete picture of patients' care needs that require nursing interventions. The implication of this study involves pressure ulcer prevention and litigable risk of nursing documentation.},

abstract = {At present, the solutions to prevent bedsore include using various techniques for movement and displacement of patients, which is not possible for some patients or dangerous for some of them while it also poses problems for health care providers. On the other hand, development of information technology in the health care system including application of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has led to easy and quick service-providing. It can provide a solution to prevent bedsore in motionless and disabled patients. Hence, the aim of this article was first to introduce WSNs in hospital beds and second, to identify the benefits and challenges in implementing this technology. This study was a nonsystematic review. The literature was searched for WSNs to reduce and prevent bedsores with the help of libraries, databases (PubMed, SCOPUS, and EMBASE), and also searches engines available at Google Scholar including during 1974-2014 while the inclusion criteria were applied in English and Persian. In our searches, we employed the following keywords and their combinations: “wireless sensor network,” “smart bed,” “information technology,” “smart mattress,” and “bedsore” in the searching areas of titles, keywords, abstracts, and full texts. In this study, more than 45 articles and reports were collected and 37 of them were selected based on their relevance. Therefore, identification and implementation of this technology will be a step toward mechanization of traditional procedures in providing care for hospitalized patients and disabled people. The smart bed and mattress, either alone or in combination with the other technologies, should be capable of providing all of the novel features while still providing the comfort and safety features usually associated with traditional and hospital mattresses. It can eliminate the expense of bedsore in the intensive care unit (ICU) department in the hospital and save much expense there. },

Binary logistic regression predictor values for pressure ulcers and superficial skin changes were 0{\textperiodcentered}111 for type of sheet and 0{\textperiodcentered}347 for Braden Scale results. In conclusion, difference in skin temperature seems to be a predictor for pressure ulcer development and superficial skin changes, while synthetic fibre sheets are able to maintain a beneficial microclimate.},

We show that the combination of a synthetic modular genetic system with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy allows us to directly measure in real time the activity of any specific promoter in prokaryotes. Using a simple inducible gene expression system, we found that induced RNA levels within a single bacterium of Escherichia coli exhibited a pulsating profile in response to a steady input of inducer. The genetic deletion of an efflux pump system, a key determinant of antibiotic resistance, altered the pulsating transcriptional dynamics and caused overexpression of induced RNA. In contrast with population measurements, real-time RNA profiling permits identifying relationships between genotypes and transcriptional dynamics that are accessible only at the level of the single cell.},

abstract = {Clinically feasible methods of assessing postural control such as timed standing balance and functional reach tests provide important information, however, they cannot accurately quantify specific postural control mechanisms. The Microsoft Kinect™ system provides real-time anatomical landmark position data in three dimensions (3D), and given that it is inexpensive, portable and simple to setup it may bridge this gap. This study assessed the concurrent validity of the Microsoft Kinect™ against a benchmark reference, a multiple-camera 3D motion analysis system, in 20 healthy subjects during three postural control tests: (i) forward reach, (ii) lateral reach, and (iii) single-leg eyes-closed standing balance. For the reach tests, the outcome measures consisted of distance reached and trunk flexion angle in the sagittal (forward reach) and coronal (lateral reach) planes. For the standing balance test the range and deviation of movement in the anatomical landmark positions for the sternum, pelvis, knee and ankle and the lateral and anterior trunk flexion angle were assessed. The Microsoft Kinect™ and 3D motion analysis systems had comparable inter-trial reliability (ICC difference=0.06±0.05; range, 0.00-0.16) and excellent concurrent validity, with Pearson's r-values {\textgreater}0.90 for the majority of measurements (r=0.96±0.04; range, 0.84-0.99). However, ordinary least products analyses demonstrated proportional biases for some outcome measures associated with the pelvis and sternum. These findings suggest that the Microsoft Kinect™ can validly assess kinematic strategies of postural control. Given the potential benefits it could therefore become a useful tool for assessing postural control in the clinical setting.},

abstract = {The debate about work-relatedness of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) reflects both confusion about epidemiologic principles and gaps in the scientific literature. The physical ergonomic features of work frequently cited as risk factors for MSDs include rapid work pace and repetitive motion, forceful exertions, non-neutral body postures, and vibration. However, some still dispute the importance of these factors, especially relative to non-occupational causes. This paper addresses the controversy with reference to a major report recently commissioned by the US Congress from the National Research Council (NRC) and Institute of Medicine (IOM) (2001). The available epidemiologic evidence is substantial, but will benefit from more longitudinal data to better evaluate gaps in knowledge concerning latency of effect, natural history, prognosis, and potential for selection bias in the form of the healthy worker effect. While objective measures may be especially useful in establishing a more secure diagnosis, subjective measures better capture patient impact. Examination techniques still do not exist that can serve as a "gold standard" for many of the symptoms that are commonly reported in workplace studies. Finally, exposure assessment has too often been limited to crude indicators, such as job title. Worker self-report, investigator observation, and direct measurement each add to understanding but the lack of standardized exposure metrics limits ability to compare findings among studies. Despite these challenges, the epidemiologic literature on work-related MSDs-in combination with extensive laboratory evidence of pathomechanisms related to work stressors-is convincing to most. The NRC/IOM report concluded, and other reviewers internationally have concurred, that the etiologic importance of occupational ergonomic stressors for the occurrence of MSDs of the low back and upper extremities has been demonstrated.},

This literature review examines six studies conducted on this controversial subject.

Our framework enables a wearable gaming control solution that differs from the conventional methods using joysticks, key boards or mice. The framework was implemented on a racing-type game. The results suggested that our framework was fully functioning.

abstract = {Background Pressure ulcers are one of the most underrated conditions in critically ill patients. Despite the introduction of clinical practice guidelines and advances in medical technology, the prevalence of pressure ulcers in hospitalized patients continues to escalate. Currently, consensus is lacking on the most important risk factors for pressure ulcers in critically ill patients, and no risk assessment scale exclusively for pressure ulcers in these patients is available.Objective To determine which risk factors are most predictive of pressure ulcers in adult critical care patients. Risk factors investigated included total score on the Braden Scale, mobility, activity, sensory perception, moisture, friction/shear, nutrition, age, blood pressure, length of stay in the intensive care unit, score on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, vasopressor administration, and comorbid conditions.Methods A retrospective, correlational design was used to examine 347 patients admitted to a medical-surgical intensive care unit from October 2008 through May 2009.Results According to direct logistic regression analyses, age, length of stay, mobility, friction/shear, norepinephrine infusion, and cardiovascular disease explained a major part of the variance in pressure ulcers.Conclusion Current risk assessment scales for development of pressure ulcers may not include risk factors common in critically ill adults. Development of a risk assessment model for pressure ulcers in these patients is warranted and could be the foundation for development of a risk assessment tool. },

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the relation between neck pain and work related neck flexion, neck rotation, and sitting. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed with a follow up of 3 years among 1334 workers from 34 companies. Work related physical load was assessed by analysing objectively measured exposure data (video recordings) of neck flexion, neck rotation, and sitting posture. Neck pain was assessed by a questionnaire. Adjustments were made for various physical factors that were related or not related to work, psychosocial factors, and individual characteristics. RESULTS: A significant positive relation was found between the percentage of the working time in a sitting position and neck pain, implying an increased risk of neck pain for workers who were sitting for more than 95{\%} of the working time (crude relative risk (RR) 2.01, 95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI) 1.04 to 3.88; adjusted RR 2.34, 95{\%} CI 1.05 to 5.21). A trend for a positive relation between neck flexion and neck pain was found, suggesting an increased risk of neck pain for people working with the neck at a minimum of 20 degrees of flexion for more than 70{\%} of the working time (crude RR 2.01, 95{\%} CI 0.98 to 4.11; adjusted RR 1.63, 95{\%} CI 0.70 to 3.82). No clear relation was found between neck rotation and neck pain. CONCLUSION: Sitting at work for more than 95{\%} of the working time seems to be a risk factor for neck pain and there is a trend for a positive relation between neck flexion and neck pain. No clear relation was found between neck rotation and neck pain.},

abstract = {The aim was to investigate inter-tester and intra-tester reliability and parallel reliability between a visual assessment method and a method using a pachymeter for locating the mid-point of the patella in determining the medial/lateral patella orientation. Fifteen asymptomatic subjects were assessed and the mid-point of the patella was determined by both methods on two separate occasions two weeks apart. Inter-tester reliability was obtained by ANOVA and by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC); intra-tester reliability was obtained by a paired t-test and ICC; and parallel reliability was obtained by Pearson's Correlation and ICC, for the measurement on the first and second evaluations. There was acceptable inter-tester agreement (p=0.490) and reliability for the visual inspection (ICC=0.747) and for the pachymeter (ICC=0.716) at the second evaluation. The inter-tester reliability in the first evaluation was unacceptable (visual ICC=0.604; pachymeter ICC=0.612). Although there was statistical similarity between measurements for the first and second evaluations for all testers, intra-tester reliability was not acceptable for both methods: visual (examiner 1 ICC=0.175; examiner 2 ICC=0.189; examiner 3 ICC=0.155) and pachymeter (examiner 1 ICC=0.214; examiner 2 ICC=0.246; examiner 3 ICC=0.069). Parallel reliability gave a perfect correlation at the first evaluation (r=0.828; p{\textless}0.001) and at the second (r=0.756; p{\textless}0.001) and reliability was between acceptable and very good (ICC=[0.748-0.813]). Both visual and pachymeter methods provide reliable and similar medial/lateral patella orientation and are reliable between different examiners, but the results between the two assessments at 2 weeks' interval demonstrated an unacceptable reliability.},

abstract = {This paper presents the sensor network infrastructure for a home care system that allows long-term monitoring of physiological data and everyday activities. The aim of the proposed system is to allow the elderly to live longer in their home without compromising safety and ensuring the detection of health problems. The system offers the possibility of a virtual visit via a teleoperated robot. During the visit, physiological data and activities occurring during a period of time can be discussed. These data are collected from physiological sensors (e.g., temperature, blood pressure, glucose) and environmental sensors (e.g., motion, bed/chair occupancy, electrical usage). The system can also give alarms if sudden problems occur, like a fall, and warnings based on more long-term trends, such as the deterioration of health being detected. It has been implemented and tested in a test environment and has been deployed in six real homes for a year-long evaluation. The key contribution of the paper is the presentation of an implemented system for ambient assisted living (AAL) tested in a real environment, combining the acquisition of sensor data, a flexible and adaptable middleware compliant with the OSGistandard and a context recognition application. The system has been developed in a European project called GiraffPlus.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Cell division in Escherichia coli is morphologically symmetric. However, as unwanted protein aggregates are segregated to the cell poles and, after divisions, accumulate at older poles, generate asymmetries in sister cells' vitality. Novel single-molecule detection techniques allow observing aging-related processes in vivo, over multiple generations, informing on the underlying mechanisms.

RESULTS: CellAging is a tool to automatically extract information on polar segregation and partitioning in division of aggregates in E.coli, and on cellular vitality. From time-lapse, parallel brightfield and fluorescence microscopy images, it performs cell segmentation, alignment of brightfield and fluorescence images, lineage construction and pole age determination, and it computes aging-related features. We exemplify its use by analyzing spatial distributions of fluorescent protein aggregates from images of cells across generations.

AVAILABILITY: CellAging, instructions and an example are available at http://www.cs.tut.fi/{\%}7esanchesr/cellaging/.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {Pressure ulcers are costly and life-threatening complications for people with spinal cord injury (SCI). People with SCI also exhibit differential blood flow properties in non-ulcerated skin. We hypothesized that a computer simulation of the pressure ulcer formation process, informed by data regarding skin blood flow and reactive hyperemia in response to pressure, could provide insights into the pathogenesis and effective treatment of post-SCI pressure ulcers. Agent-Based Models (ABM) are useful in settings such as pressure ulcers, in which spatial realism is important. Ordinary Differential Equation-based (ODE) models are useful when modeling physiological phenomena such as reactive hyperemia. Accordingly, we constructed a hybrid model that combines ODEs related to blood flow along with an ABM of skin injury, inflammation, and ulcer formation. The relationship between pressure and the course of ulcer formation, as well as several other important characteristic patterns of pressure ulcer formation, was demonstrated in this model. The ODE portion of this model was calibrated to data related to blood flow following experimental pressure responses in non-injured human subjects or to data from people with SCI. This model predicted a higher propensity to form ulcers in response to pressure in people with SCI vs. non-injured control subjects, and thus may serve as novel diagnostic platform for post-SCI ulcer formation.},

This study describes quantity and quality of movement during Nintendo Wii and Wii Fit game play, explores differences in these movement characteristics between games and between novice and experienced players, and investigates whether motivation to succeed at the game impacts movement characteristics. Thirty-eight children (aged 7-12) with and without previous game experience played Wii (boxing and tennis) and Wii Fit (ski slalom and soccer heading) games. Force plate data provided center of pressure displacement (quantity) and processed pelvis motion indicated smoothness of pelvic movement (quality). Children rated their motivation to succeed at each game. Movement quantity and quality differed between games (p{\textless}.001). Children with previous experience playing Wii Fit games demonstrated greater movement quantity during Wii Fit game play (p{\textless}.001); quality of movement did not differ between groups. Motivation to succeed did not influence the relationship between experience and outcomes. Findings enhance clinical understanding of this technology and inform the development of research questions to explore its potential to improve movement skills in children with motor impairments.},

abstract = {RATIONALE AND AIMS: Numerous prevalence studies have been conducted. The problem with these studies is that prevalence proportions cannot be compared with each other, because of differences in performance of each survey. There is no agreed standardized method for determining prevalence proportions. This study aimed to develop and pilot a uniform data collection instrument and methodology to measure the pressure ulcer prevalence and to get some insight into pressure ulcer prevalence across different patient groups in Europe.

METHODS: Pressure ulcer experts from different European countries developed a data collection instrument, which included five categories of data: general data, patient data, risk assessment, skin observation and prevention. A convenience sample of university and general hospitals of Belgium, Italy, Portugal, UK and Sweden participated in the study. In each participating hospital, teams of two trained nurses who collected the data on the wards were established. All patients admitted before midnight on the day of the survey and older than 18 years were included.

RESULTS: The data collection instrument and study procedure of the survey were found to be effective by all participants. 5947 patients were surveyed in 25 hospitals in five European countries. The pressure ulcer prevalence (grade 1-4) was 18.1{\%} and if grade 1 ulcers were excluded, it was 10.5{\%}. The sacrum and heels were the most affected locations. Only 9.7{\%} of the patients in need of prevention received fully adequate preventive care.

CONCLUSION: The methodology is sufficiently robust to measure and compare pressure ulcer prevalence in different countries. The pressure ulcer prevalence was higher than expected and relatively few patients received adequate prevention. This indicates that more attention to prevention is needed in Europe.},

abstract = {A previous study defined sitting comfort and discomfort as independent entities associated with different factors: discomfort is related to biomechanics and fatigue factors, and comfort to a sense of well-being and aesthetics. In this study a checklist for evaluation of chair comfort and discomfort was analysed in two field studies. In the first study two groups of subjects, ten secretaries and ten managers, evaluated two groups of ten chairs. Subjects assessed each chair three times during a workday using three different types of scales. The results of a factor analysis reconfirmed the factor structure of comfort and discomfort. Analysis of variance demonstrated that discomfort was related to fatigue accumulated during the workday, but it was not related to chair design. There was no significant Chair x Time period interaction, which implies that the rank order of preference among a set of chairs was established during the first assessment and did not change during the day. In a second field study 37 secretaries used three different formats of a Chair Evaluation Checklist with 14 items. The results of a factor analysis again confirmed the factor structure of comfort and discomfort. Analyses of variance demonstrated that subjects can evaluate comfort and discomfort simultaneously without any halo-effect. The results have methodological implications for measurement of comfort and discomfort. The findings for comfort, as defined, carry an important message that aesthetic design matters. This could provide a unifying focus for ergonomists and designers.},

This paper describes a smart calibration algorithm designed to facilitate video game play by people with movement impairment. The algorithm continuously adapts the calibration of the gaming input device by comparing the maximum range of motion measured in previous time periods, then adjusting the current required range of motion based on their difference. In several experiments with simple acceleration-based video games using a Nintendo Wiimote, we show that the algorithm adapts the calibration to allow healthy users to play the game with their full available range of acceleration without need for a special calibration protocol. Importantly, the algorithm described here can be used without altering the game software by inserting a hardware or software module between the gaming input device and the game console. Thus, the algorithm can be used with off-the-shelf video games without altering their source code.},

Our methodology is designed to validate our claims that: (1) drug prescription data on the day of admission contain rich information about the patient's situation and perspectives of evolution, and (2) the various perspectives of big medical data (such as veracity, volume, variety) help in extracting this information. We build binary classification models to identify at-risk patient profiles. We use a distributed architecture to ensure scalability of model construction with large volumes of medical records and clinical data. We report on practical experiments with real data of millions of patients and hundreds of hospitals. We demonstrate how the fine-grained analysis of such big data can improve the detection of at-risk patients, making it possible to construct more accurate predictive models that significantly benefit from volume and variety, while satisfying important criteria to be deployed in hospitals.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the annual cost of treating pressure ulcers in the UK. DESIGN: Costs were derived from a bottom-up methodology, based on the daily resources required to deliver protocols of care reflecting good clinical practice. SETTING: Health and social care system in the UK. SUBJECTS: Patients developing a pressure ulcer. METHODS: A bottom-up costing approach is used to estimate treatment cost per episode of care and per patient for ulcers of different grades and level of complications. Also, total treatment cost to the health and social care system in the UK. RESULTS: The cost of treating a pressure ulcer varies from pound 1,064 (Grade 1) to pound 10,551 (Grade 4). Costs increase with ulcer grade because the time to heal is longer and because the incidence of complications is higher in more severe cases. The total cost in the UK is pound 1.4- pound 2.1 billion annually (4{\%} of total NHS expenditure). Most of this cost is nurse time. CONCLUSIONS: Pressure ulcers represent a very significant cost burden in the UK. Without concerted effort this cost is likely to increase in the future as the population ages. To the extent that pressure ulcers are avoidable, pressure damage may be indicative of clinical negligence and there is evidence that litigation could soon become a significant threat to healthcare providers in the UK, as it is in the USA.},

The paper investigates the effect of combining data from accelerometers placed at various bodily locations on the accuracy of activity detection. Eight healthy males participated within the study. Data were collected from six wireless tri-axial accelerometers placed at the chest, wrist, lower back, hip, thigh and foot. Activities included walking, running on a motorized treadmill, sitting, lying, standing and walking up and down stairs. The Support Vector Machine provided the most accurate detection of activities of all the machine learning algorithms investigated. Although data from all locations provided similar levels of accuracy, the hip was the best single location to record data for activity detection using a Support Vector Machine, providing small but significantly better accuracy than the other investigated locations. Increasing the number of sensing locations from one to two or more statistically increased the accuracy of classification. There was no significant difference in accuracy when using two or more sensors. It was noted, however, that the difference in activity detection using single or multiple accelerometers may be more pronounced when trying to detect finer grain activities. Future work shall therefore investigate the effects of accelerometer placement on a larger range of these activities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The evidence regarding the use of feeding tubes in persons with advanced dementia to prevent or heal pressure ulcers is conflicting. Using national data, we set out to determine whether percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes prevent or help heal pressure ulcers in nursing home (NH) residents with advanced cognitive impairment (ACI).

METHODS: A propensity-matched cohort study of NH residents with ACI and recent need for assistance in eating was conducted by matching each NH resident who had a feeding tube inserted during a hospitalization to 3 without a PEG tube inserted. Using the Minimum Data Set (MDS), we examined 2 outcomes: first, whether residents without a pressure ulcer developed a stage 2 or higher pressure ulcer (n = 1124 with PEG insertion); and second, whether NH residents with a pressure ulcer (n = 461) experienced improvement of the pressure ulcer by their first posthospitalization MDS assessment (mean [SD] time between evaluations, 24.6 [32.7] days).

RESULTS: Matched residents with and without a PEG insertion showed comparable sociodemographic characteristic, rates of feeding tube risk factors, and mortality. Adjusted for risk factors, hospitalized NH residents receiving a PEG tube were 2.27 times more likely to develop a new pressure ulcer (95{\%} CI, 1.95-2.65). Conversely, those with a pressure ulcer were less likely to have the ulcer heal when they had a PEG tube inserted (OR 0.70 [95{\%} CI, 0.55-0.89]).

CONCLUSIONS: Feeding tubes are not associated with prevention or improved healing of a pressure ulcer. Rather, our findings suggest that the use of PEG tube is associated with increased risk of pressure ulcers among NH residents with ACI.},

@book{Sorvaj2013,
abstract = {Two advanced optical techniques for the detection of alkali vapors in high-temperature gases are introduced in this Thesis. Alkali vapors are released in solid fuel combustion and increase the maintenance costs of the power plant boilers. Especially, biomass and waste are challenging fuels for contemporary technology. Alkali related problems are controlled with proper fuel mixture ratios and additives that are mixed to fuels or sprayed into the boiler. However, the controlling increases the cost of the produced energy and the additives increase SO2 concentration. In order to study the alkali formation mechanisms and to control alkali concentrations in power plant boilers, fast, accurate and highly sensitive detection techniques are needed. This Thesis presents the fundamental absorption properties of the K, KCl and KOH vapors, reviews previously applied techniques for the detection of alkalis, and intro- duces two novel detection methods. The first method is based on the Photoacoustic Spectroscopy (PAS), that utilizes two branches of physics, namely optics and acous- tics. A high-temperature PAS cell is introduced and applied to detect KCl and NaCl. Moreover, the possibility to apply the PAS cell to high-temperature salt-induced metal oxidation is discussed. The second method, which was fully developed during this work, is called Collinear Photofragmentation and Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (CPFAAS). CPFAAS pro- vides the limit of detection below parts per billion and the dynamic range of eight orders of magnitude in the detection of alkali chlorides. Moreover, the detection time of the CPFAAS measurement is in the order of micro second, which enables the diag- nostics of the fast changing processes, such as combustion. The technique is calibration free and is integrable to ”see-through” applications. In this Thesis, CPFAAS is ap- plied to determine potassium vapor concentrations from a laboratory cell, flue gases emanated from 10 mg fuel samples, and flue gases in intermediate and large scale com- bustion boilers. The presented applications, modeling and comparison with previously applied detection methods show that CPFAAS enables new detection and monitoring capabilities from corrosive high temperature gases.},

abstract = {The global environmental monitoring market is poised to grow at a CAGR of 7.5{\%} during 2015-2020, and is expected to reach a value of {\~{}}{\$}20.5 Billion in 2020. Although the mature markets (such as the U.S., Germany, France, and U.K.) hold larger shares in the environmental monitoring market, the Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow at the highest CAGR in the forecast period. The growth of the environmental monitoring market is driven by factors such as growing global population, development of policies and initiatives aimed to reduce air, soil, and water pollution, increasing government funding towards pollution prevention and control, growing construction of environmental monitoring stations, growing initiative towards the development of environment-friendly industries, and reduction in export tariff on environmental monitoring technologies in emerging and developed markets. However, factors such as high cost of environmental monitoring solutions, slow implementation of pollution control reforms, and high export barrier on environmental technologies in emerging markets are restraining the growth of this market. Uncertain and inconsistent regulations and standards in emerging market is posing a significant challenge for the growth of the environmental monitoring market. In this report, the global environmental monitoring market has been segmented on the basis of type of products (environmental monitors, environmental sensors, and environmental software), type of sampling method (intermittent monitoring, continuous monitoring, passive monitoring, and active monitoring), type of sensors (analog, digital, temperature sensing, moisture detection, biological detection, chemical detection, and noise measurement), and type of application (air pollution, water pollution, soil pollution, and noise pollution monitoring). The environmental monitors segment is expected to account for the largest share of the global environmental monitoring products market, in 2015, followed by the environmental sensors market. Factors such as growing public pressure on respective regional governments for effective pollution control and development of environment-friendly industries, rising government funding to develop large-scale environmental monitoring systems, continuous public and private initiatives to reduce the threat of climate change and depletion of natural resources, and development and commercialization of innovative technologies for pollution monitoring and control are driving the growth of environmental monitors market. Geographically, North America (comprising the U.S. and Canada) is expected to command the largest share of the global environmental monitoring market in 2015, followed by Europe. The environmental monitoring market in the North America is primarily driven by factors such as increasing government funding on the maintenance and operation of environmental monitoring technology networking, stringent regulations of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) on air quality standards, technological advancements in design and technology of environmental sensors, and growing government initiatives towards pollution prevention and control. However, inconsistent government policies with regard to approval and use of environmental monitoring technology are limiting the growth of the digital environmental monitoring market in this region. The Asia-Pacific region is poised to grow at the highest CAGR during next five years, owing to factors such as large-scale industrialization, changing international environmental policies, and growing need to comply with various environmental safety regulations across the region. The global environmental monitoring market is a highly competitive with a various global as well as local market players. As of 2014, the global environmental monitoring market was dominated by Agilent Technologies, Inc. (U.S.), TE Connectivity Ltd. (Switzerland), Danaher Corporation (U.S.), Honeywell International, Inc. (U.S.), and Siemens AG (Germany). New product launches, partnerships, agreements, and collaborations, and strategic acquisitions are the major strategies adopted by most of the market players to achieve growth in the global environmental monitoring market.},

The report was prepared with the support of, and contributions from, BIS, DECC and Defra. The focus of this report is UK LCEGS performance in 2011/12, but to achieve this comparisons are made with baseline figures from 2008/09 to 2010/11 and benchmark comparisons are made with other leading global economies. The analysis is quantitative rather than qualitative, emphasising what we believe “is” rather than what it means. The enrichment process of adding context and meaning to the data is quite rightly the prerogative of the industry and its specialist representatives. The methodology for this study is both traditional and innovatory. It is traditional in that it focuses on key measures of economic performance- sales, growth, companies, employment, importing and exporting- but innovatory in how the evidence base has been assembled and assessed from a very wide variety of public, private, academic, institutional and industrial sources looking forward over a five year period. The research data is global and detailed, with measurement of approximately 2800 different goods and services included. The data is also hierarchically structured which means that analysis can be conducted at global, national, regional and sub regional level and products and services can be disaggregated into a number of different levels of detail, although much of this is summarised at the sub sector level.},

abstract = {Differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) has become a widely used method to measure trace gases in the atmosphere. Their concentration is retrieved by a numerical analysis of the atmospheric absorption spectra, which often are a combination of overlapping absorption structures of several trace gases. A new analysis procedure was developed, modeling atmospheric spectra with the absorption structures of the individual trace gases, to determine their concentrations. The procedure also corrects differences in the wavelength-pixel mapping of these spectra. A new method to estimate the error of the concentrations considers the uncertainty of this correction and the influence of random residual structures in the absorption spectra.},

Greenhouse gas emissions, however, are not analysed here, but in a specific article. Air pollution caused by human activities, including industrial and energy production, the burning of fossil fuels and increased use of certain types of transport, causes serious health problems for hundreds of thousands of Europeans every year. Environmental damage such as acidification, eutrophication, tropospheric (ground-level) ozone and reduced air quality, especially in urban areas, can be a local as well as a transboundary problem as air pollutants are transported in the atmosphere and harm human health and the environment elsewhere.},

CPSs are expected to have a tremendous impact on many critical sectors (such as energy, manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, and aerospace) of the economy. CPSs have the ability to transform the way human-to-human, human-to-object, and object-to-object interactions take place in the physical and virtual worlds. The increasing pervasiveness of wireless sensor networking (WSN) technologies in many applications makes them an important component of emerging CPS designs. We present some of the most important design requirements of CPS architectures. We discuss key sensor network characteristics that can be leveraged in CPS designs. In addition, we also review a few well-known CPS application domains that depend on WSNs in their design architectures and implementations. Finally, we present some of the challenges that still need to be addressed to enable seamless integration of WSN with CPS designs.},

abstract = {The photolysis of nitrous acid (HONO) in the early morning hours is believed to be a significant source of hydroxyl radicals (OH), the most important daytime oxidizing species. Although the importance of this mechanism has been recognized for many years, no accurate experimental quantification is available. Here we present measurements of HONO, NO2, SO2, O-3 and HCHO by Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) during the Limitation of Oxidant Production/Pianura Padana Produzione di Ozono (LOOP/PIPAPO) study in May-June 1998 in Milan, Italy. The concentration of NO and J(NO2)/J(HONO) were simultaneously monitored by in situ monitors. The photolysis frequencies of HCHO and O-3 were determined with a radiative transfer model. High nocturnal HONO mixing ratios of up to 4.4 ppb were regularly observed. Elevated daytime HONO levels during cloudy periods show that the formation of HONO proceeds after sunrise and therefore also represents a source of hydroxyl radicals throughout the day. Averaged over 24 hours, HCHO photolysis is the most important source of OH in Milan, followed by either ozone or HONO photolysis. Our observations indicate that on certain days the OH production from HONO can be even more important than that from ozone photolysis.

abstract = {Two advanced optical techniques for the detection of alkali vapors in high-temperature gases are introduced in this Thesis. Alkali vapors are released in solid fuel combustion and increase the maintenance costs of the power plant boilers. Especially, biomass and waste are challenging fuels for contemporary technology. Alkali related problems are controlled with proper fuel mixture ratios and additives that are mixed to fuels or sprayed into the boiler. However, the controlling increases the cost of the produced energy and the additives increase SO2 concentration. In order to study the alkali formation mechanisms and to control alkali concentrations in power plant boilers, fast, accurate and highly sensitive detection techniques are needed. This Thesis presents the fundamental absorption properties of the K, KCl and KOH vapors, reviews previously applied techniques for the detection of alkalis, and intro- duces two novel detection methods. The first method is based on the Photoacoustic Spectroscopy (PAS), that utilizes two branches of physics, namely optics and acous- tics. A high-temperature PAS cell is introduced and applied to detect KCl and NaCl. Moreover, the possibility to apply the PAS cell to high-temperature salt-induced metal oxidation is discussed. The second method, which was fully developed during this work, is called Collinear Photofragmentation and Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (CPFAAS). CPFAAS pro- vides the limit of detection below parts per billion and the dynamic range of eight orders of magnitude in the detection of alkali chlorides. Moreover, the detection time of the CPFAAS measurement is in the order of micro second, which enables the diag- nostics of the fast changing processes, such as combustion. The technique is calibration free and is integrable to ”see-through” applications. In this Thesis, CPFAAS is ap- plied to determine potassium vapor concentrations from a laboratory cell, flue gases emanated from 10 mg fuel samples, and flue gases in intermediate and large scale com- bustion boilers. The presented applications, modeling and comparison with previously applied detection methods show that CPFAAS enables new detection and monitoring capabilities from corrosive high temperature gases.},

@misc{Banta1992,
abstract = {Abstract To demonstrate the usefulness of active remote-sensing systems in observing forest fire plume behavior, we studied two fires, one using a 3.2-cm-wavelength Doppler radar, and one more extensively, using Doppler lidar. Both instruments observed the kinematics of the convection column, including the presence of two different types of rotation in the columns, and monitored the behavior of the smoke plume. The first fire, a forest fire that burned out of control, was observed by the Doppler radar during late-morning and afternoon hours. Strong horizontal ambient winds produced a bent-over convection column, which the radar observed to have strong horizontal flow at its edges and weaker flow along the centerline of the plume. This velocity pattern implies that the column consisted of a pair of counterrotating horizontal vortices (rolls), with rising motion along the centerline and sinking along the edges. The radar tracked the smoke plume for over 30 km. It also provided circular depolarization ratio measurements, which gave information that the scattering particles were mostly flat or needle shaped as viewed by the radar, perhaps pine needles or possibly flat ash platelets being viewed edge on. The second fire, observed over a 5-h period by Doppler lidar, was a prescribed forest fire ignited in the afternoon. During the first hour of the fire the lidar observed many kinematic quantities of the convection column, including flow convergence and anticyclonic whole-column, rotation of the nearly vertical column, with a vorticity of approximately 10?2 s?1 and an estimated peak vertical velocity w of 1 5 m s?1. After the first hour ambient meteorological conditions changed, the whole-column rotation ceased, and the convection column and smoke plume bent over toward the lidar in stronger horizontal flow. At two times during this later stage, w was estimated to be 24 and 10 m s?1. Lidar observations show that the smoke plume of this second fire initially went straight up in the convection column to heights of over 2 km, so most of the smoke was injected into the atmosphere above the unstable, afternoon, convective boundary layer, or mixed layer. Later, as the horizontal winds increased, a larger friction of the smoke remained in the mixed layer. Finally, very late in the afternoon, after ignitions had ceased and the fire was smoldering, almost all of the smoke remained within the mixed layer. These analyses show that lidar and radar can provide valuable three-dimensional datasets on kinematic quantities and smoke distribution in the vicinity of fires. This kind of information should be of great value in understanding and modeling convection-column dynamics and smoke-plume behavior.},

abstract = {Because of their effectiveness in broad practical applications, LSTM networks have received a wealth of coverage in scientific journals, technical blogs, and implementation guides. However, in most articles, the inference formulas for the LSTM network and its parent, RNN, are stated axiomatically, while the training formulas are omitted altogether. In addition, the technique of "unrolling" an RNN is routinely presented without justification throughout the literature. The goal of this paper is to explain the essential RNN and LSTM fundamentals in a single document. Drawing from concepts in signal processing, we formally derive the canonical RNN formulation from differential equations. We then propose and prove a precise statement, which yields the RNN unrolling technique. We also review the difficulties with training the standard RNN and address them by transforming the RNN into the "Vanilla LSTM" network through a series of logical arguments. We provide all equations pertaining to the LSTM system together with detailed descriptions of its constituent entities. Albeit unconventional, our choice of notation and the method for presenting the LSTM system emphasizes ease of understanding. As part of the analysis, we identify new opportunities to enrich the LSTM system and incorporate these extensions into the Vanilla LSTM network, producing the most general LSTM variant to date. The target reader has already been exposed to RNNs and LSTM networks through numerous available resources and is open to an alternative pedagogical approach. A Machine Learning practitioner seeking guidance for implementing our new augmented LSTM model in software for experimentation and research will find the insights and derivations in this tutorial valuable as well.},

One of these particular approaches, using measurements along horizontal paths, has already been tested with the spectrometer installed on board the Geophysica aircraft during stratospheric flights up to altitudes of 20 km. The theoretical basis of these new measurement techniques using DOAS remote sensing systems are delineated to assess whether low altitude flights can provide 2D and 3D pollution tomography over metropolitan areas. The 2D or 3D trace gas total column mapping could be used to investigate: i) transport and dispersion phenomena of air pollution, ii) photochemical process rates, iii) gas plume tomography, iv) minor gas vertical profiles into the Planetary Boundary Layer and v) minor gas flux divergence over a large area.},

abstract = {The multi purpose UV-Vis. Spectrometer for Atmospheric Tracers Measurement (SPATRAM) is installed at the Observatory of the Geophysics Centre of Evora (38.5{\textordmasculine} N, 7.9{\textordmasculine} W) – Portugal, since 2004, measuring the zenith scattered radiation in the 300-550 nm spectral range. The main products are the total column and the vertical profiles of NO 2 and O 3 obtained with the application of the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) algorithms and with inversion schemes based on the Optimal Estimation methods respectively. Recently (February 2009), the MIGE (Multiple Input Geometry Equipment) was coupled to the SPATRAM instrument allowing for the measurements of the diffused radiation in directions away from the zenith one (Off-Axis). MIGE is an alt-azimuth platform based on a very simple optical layout, using an optical fibre to transmit the radiation inside the monochromator of the SPATRAM equipment. Thanks to the solution adopted in the developing phase, MIGE is able to scan the whole hemisphere. In this work, after a brief description of the MIGE, the first and preliminary results for vertical profiles of NO 2 in the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL), and the values of Slant Column Densities (SCD) of O 3 and SO 2 measured in Off-Axis configuration at Evora Station, are presented and discussed.},

We propose some innovative solutions in the field of DOAS (Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) remote systems, utilizing diffuse so- lar light as the radiation source. We examine the numerous potentialities of minor gas slant column calculations, applying the «off-axis» methodology for collecting the diffuse solar radiation. One of these particular approaches, using measurements along horizontal paths, has already been tested with the spectrometer installed on board the Geophysica aircraft during stratospheric flights up to altitudes of 20 km. The theoretical basis of these new meas- urement techniques using DOAS remote sensing systems are delineated to assess whether low altitude flights can provide 2D and 3D pollution tomography over metropolitan areas. The 2D or 3D trace gas total column mapping could be used to investigate: i) transport and dispersion phenomena of air pollution, ii) photochemical process rates, iii) gas plume tomography, iv) minor gas vertical profiles into the Planetary Boundary Layer and v) minor gas flux divergence over a large area.},

abstract = {Data from a recent field campaign in Mexico City are used to evaluate the performance of the EPA Federal Ref-erence Method for monitoring the ambient concentrations of NO 2 . Measurements of NO 2 from standard chemilumines-cence monitors equipped with molybdenum oxide converters are compared with those from Tunable Infrared Laser Differ-ential Absorption Spectroscopy (TILDAS) and Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) instruments. A significant interference in the chemiluminescence measure-ment is shown to account for up to 50{\%} of ambient NO 2 con-centration during afternoon hours. As expected, this interfer-ence correlates well with non-NO x reactive nitrogen species (NO z) as well as with ambient O 3 concentrations, indicat-ing a photochemical source for the interfering species. A combination of ambient gas phase nitric acid and alkyl and multifunctional alkyl nitrates is deduced to be the primary cause of the interference. Observations at four locations at varying proximities to emission sources indicate that the per-centage contribution of HNO 3 to the interference decreases with time as the air parcel ages. Alkyl and multifunctional alkyl nitrate concentrations are calculated to reach concen-Correspondence to: E. J. Dunlea (edward.dunlea@colorado.edu) trations as high as several ppb inside the city, on par with the highest values previously observed in other urban loca-tions. Averaged over the MCMA-2003 field campaign, the chemiluminescence monitor interference resulted in an av-erage measured NO 2 concentration up to 22{\%} greater than that from co-located spectroscopic measurements. Thus, this interference has the potential to initiate regulatory action in areas that are close to non-attainment and may mislead atmo-spheric photochemical models used to assess control strate-gies for photochemical oxidants.},

Pressure maps for eleven standardized postures were gathered in order to automatically detect the user's posture, with resource to neural networks classifiers. First the authors tried to find the best parameters for the neural network classification of our data, obtaining an overall classification of around 80{\%} for eleven standardized postures. Those neural networks were then exported to a mobile application to achieve a real-time classification of the standardized postures. Results showed a real-time classification of 93.4{\%} for eight standardized postures, even for users that experimented for the first-time our intelligent chair. Using the same mobile application they devised and implemented two correction algorithms, acting due to conformation change of the bladders in the chair's seat when a poor seating posture is detected for certain periods of time.},

Phallometric testing included visual and auditory depictions of prepubescent, pubescent, and adult males and females. The results for offenders against women showed that those who had had sexual contact with the greatest number of women (consenting or nonconsenting) had the lowest probability of being diagnosed as pedophilic. Specificity, calculated for those who had sexual contact with the most women and thus the most evidence of attraction to them, was 96{\%}. Sensitivity, calculated analogously for men with the most offenses against children, was 61{\%}.},

abstract = {Previous research has found that pedophilic men referred for clinical assessment of their sexual behavior are more likely to report that they suffered head injuries before their 13th birthday than are nonpedophilic men referred for the same purpose. This study investigated whether pedophilic patients are also more likely to report head injuries after their 13th birthday. The 685 participants represented all patients with usable data from a consecutive series of men referred to a clinical laboratory specializing in phallometric assessment of erotic preferences. In addition to phallometric testing, participants were administered a brief neuropsychological test battery and a companion interview, which included questions on head injury, drug abuse, and childhood diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The results showed that the pedophilic patients reported more head injuries before age 13 than did the nonpedophilic patients, but they did not report more head injuries after age 13. The association between pedophilia and childhood head injuries could mean either that subtle brain damage after birth increases a boy's risk of pedophilia, or that neurodevelopmental problems before birth increase a boy's accident-proneness along with his risk of pedophilia. Additional analyses showed that self-reported head injuries before age 13 were associated with attentional problems and with left-handedness; in contrast, head injuries after age 13 were associated with drug abuse and promiscuity. These analyses suggest that, among patients with primary presenting complaints of sexual rather than cognitive problems, childhood head injuries cluster with neuropsychological phenomena, whereas later head injuries cluster with lifestyle variables.},

abstract = {Accurate and consistent classification of causes and associated conditions for perinatal deaths is essential to inform strategies to reduce the five million which occur globally each year. With the majority of deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), their needs must be prioritised. The aim of this paper is to review the classification of perinatal death, the contemporary classification systems including the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases – Perinatal Mortality (ICD-PM), and next steps. During the period from 2009 to 2014, a total of 81 new or modified classification systems were identified with the majority developed in high-income countries (HICs). Structure, definitions and rules and therefore data on causes vary widely and implementation is suboptimal. Whereas system testing is limited, none appears ideal. Several systems result in a high proportion of unexplained stillbirths, prompting HICs to use more detailed systems that require data unavailable in low-income countries. Some systems appear to perform well across these different settings. ICD-PM addresses some shortcomings of ICD-10 for perinatal deaths, but important limitations remain, especially for stillbirths. A global approach to classification is needed and seems feasible. The new ICD-PM system is an important step forward and improvements will be enhanced by wide-scale use and evaluation. Implementation requires national-level support and dedicated resources. Future research should focus on implementation strategies and evaluation methods, defining placental pathologies, and ways to engage parents in the process.},

abstract = {Stillbirth definitions vary between countries around the globe. The purpose of this paper was to explore stillbirth definitions used by high income countries around the world, specifically compared to Ireland, their stillbirth and mortality rates and to examine how these rates are influenced by standards of care, especially resuscitation efforts within the delivery room for very preterm infants. A literature review was performed using PubMed, Academic Search Complete, MEDLINE, and CINAHL. These databases were searched with the terms “(stillbirth OR still birth OR stillborn) AND (definition OR registration OR registry)” and “(fetal OR neonatal OR neonate) AND Viability AND Gestational Age” in two separate searches. The database searches returned 1081 results involving stillbirths and 164 results for neonatal viability. After title, abstract, full text review, and reference review 33 papers remained for use in this study. Within the European Union (EU), 59.2 {\%} (n = 16), 14.8 {\%} (n = 4), 11.1 {\%} (n = 3), and 3.7 {\%} (n = 1) countries classify stillbirths at gestational ages of ≥22 weeks, ≥24 weeks, ≥28 weeks, and ≥180 gestational days respectively. The median stillbirth rate in Europe using ≥28 weeks gestational age as a cut-off was 2.7 per 1000 births, but this increased to 3.3 per 1000 births when stillbirths from 24 to 27 weeks gestation were included. Of the thirteen countries whose mortality data was examined, survival rates for liveborn infants ranged from 0–37.3 {\%}, 1.1–64.5 {\%}, 31.0–77.7 {\%}, and 59.1–85.7 {\%} for the gestational ages of 22, 23, 24, and 25 weeks, respectively. In 1995, survival rates for the United Kingdom and Ireland were only 26 {\%} for those born at 24 weeks gestation, however this has almost doubled in Ireland to 56.6 {\%} in 2014–2017. Survival rates have improved to the point that, in 2014–2017, the survival rate of infants born at 23 weeks gestation (32.3 {\%}) was 6 {\%} higher than the rate for those born at 24 weeks gestation in 1995. Due to the improvement in survival rates, multiple international organisations recommend recording stillbirths from 22 weeks gestation and/or 500 g. Based on the findings from this review, and due to improving survival rates for periviable infants, it is recommended the stillbirth definition in Ireland should be updated to ≥22 weeks' gestation and ≥400 g to comply with improved medical developments.},

An early conjecture about ART is proved for one of the algorithms: it converges to the most uniform solution of the constraint equations provided by the projection data. Other convergence properties of the ART algorithms are discussed and proved. Some new ART algorithms are described. These are believed to converge to optimal reconstructions consistent with the projection data. The importance of choosing the correct ray widths in case of real projection data is demonstrated, and a method for calculating correct ray widths is given. A method is proposed for estimating the optimal number of iterations in a reconstruction. The performance of ART on real data is demonstrated both in the absence of and in the presence of noise. {\textcopyright} 1973.},

abstract = {Air pollution is composed of particulate matter (PM) and gaseous pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide and ozone. PM is classified according to size into coarse particles (PM10), fine particles (PM2.5) and ultrafine particles. We aim to provide an original review of the scientific evidence from epidemiological and experimental studies examining the cardiovascular effects of outdoor air pollution. Pooled epidemiological studies reported that a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in long-term exposure to PM2.5 was associated with an 11{\%} increase in cardiovascular mortality. Increased cardiovascular mortality was also related to long-term and short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide. Exposure to air pollution and road traffic was associated with an increased risk of arteriosclerosis, as shown by premature aortic and coronary calcification. Short-term increases in air pollution were associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and acute heart failure. The risk was increased even when pollutant concentrations were below European standards. Reinforcing the evidence from epidemiological studies, numerous experimental studies demonstrated that air pollution promotes a systemic vascular oxidative stress reaction. Radical oxygen species induce endothelial dysfunction, monocyte activation and some proatherogenic changes in lipoproteins, which initiate plaque formation. Furthermore, air pollution favours thrombus formation, because of an increase in coagulation factors and platelet activation. Experimental studies also indicate that some pollutants have more harmful cardiovascular effects, such as combustion-derived PM2.5 and ultrafine particles. Air pollution is a major contributor to cardiovascular diseases. Promotion of safer air quality appears to be a new challenge in cardiovascular disease prevention.},

abstract = {A stillbirth is defined as an infant born weighing 500 g and/or more or at a gestational age of 24 weeks who shows no signs of life. Having a stillborn baby has a wide range of consequences that can affect parents, family and the healthcare professionals involved. Several risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of stillbirth: including maternal medical factors, maternal characteristics, fetal factors, sociodemographic factors and behavioral factors. The aim of this work is to review the literature on risk factors that have a behavioral component. The main behaviors modulating the risk of stillbirth that have been more widely studied in the literature include use of substances (smoking, alcohol, illicit drugs and medical drugs), weight management, attendance at antenatal care and sleeping position. There is evidence in the literature that supports that all those behaviors have an impact on the risk of stillbirth, especially in the cases of smoking and drugs consumption during the pregnancy. Hence, more research is needed to establish interventions targeting these behaviors as preventive measures to reduce the risk of adverse obstetric outcomes.},

abstract = {With fewer newborns and people living longer, older people are making up an increasing fraction of the total population. Epidemiological evidence shows that older-age-related health problems affect a wide and expanding proportion of the world population. One of the major epidemiological trends of this century is the rise of chronic diseases that affect more elderly than younger people. A total of 3.7 million premature deaths worldwide in 2012 are attributable to outdoor air pollution; the susceptibility to adverse effects of air pollution is expected to differ widely between people and within the same person, and also over time. Frailty history, a measure of multi-system decline, modifies cumulative associations between air pollution and lung function. Moreover, pre-existing diseases may determine susceptibility. In the elderly, due to comorbidity, exposure to air pollutants may even be fatal. Rapid and not-well-planned urbanization is associated with high level of ambient air pollution, mainly caused by vehicular exhausts. In general, there is sufficient evidence of the adverse effects related to short-term exposure, while fewer studies have addressed the longer-term health effects. Increased pollution exposures have been associated with increased mortality, hospital admissions/emergency-room visits, mainly due to exacerbations of chronic diseases or to respiratory tract infections (e.g., pneumonia). These effects may also be modulated by ambient temperature and many studies show that the elderly are mostly vulnerable to heat waves. The association between heat and mortality in the elderly is well-documented, while less is known regarding the associations with hospital admissions. Chronic exposure to elevated levels of air pollution has been related to the incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis (CB), asthma, and emphysema. There is also growing evidence suggesting adverse effects on lung function related to long-term exposure to ambient air pollution. Few studies have assessed long-term mortality in the elderly. It is still unclear what are the pollutants most damaging to the health of the elderly. It seems that elderly subjects are more vulnerable to particulate matter (PM) than to other pollutants, with particular effect on daily cardio-respiratory mortality and acute hospital admissions. Not many studies have targeted elderly people specifically, as well as specific respiratory morbidity. Most data have shown higher risks in the elderly compared to the rest of the population. Future epidemiological cohort studies need to keep investigating the health effects of air pollutants (mainly cardiopulmonary diseases) on the elderly.},

abstract = {Volcanic eruptions emit plumes of ash and gases into the atmosphere, potentially at very high altitudes. Ash-rich plumes are hazardous for airplanes as ash is very abrasive and easily melts inside their engines. With more than 50 active volcanoes per year and the ever-increasing number of commercial flights, the safety of airplanes is a real concern. Satellite measurements are ideal for monitoring global volcanic activity and, in combination with atmospheric dispersion models, to track and forecast volcanic plumes. Here we present the Support to Aviation Control Service (SACS, http://sacs.aeronomie.be/ecosystem), which is a free online service initiated by the European Space Agency (ESA) for the near-real-time (NRT) satellite monitoring of volcanic plumes of SO2 and ash. It combines data from three ultraviolet (UV)-visible and three infrared (IR) spectrometers. The UV-vis sensors are the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) on-board the two polar orbiting meteorological satellites (MetOp-A {\&} MetOp-B) operated by the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). The IR sensors are the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) on-board MetOp-A {\&} MetOp-B. This new multi-sensor warning system of volcanic emissions is based on the selective detection of SO2 and ash. This system is optimised to avoid false alerts while at the same time limiting the number of notifications in case of large plumes. A successful rate with more than 95{\%} of notifications corresponding to true volcanic activity is obtained by the SACS system.},

@article{Gordon1974,
abstract = {Algebraic Reconstruction Techniques (ART) were introduced by Gordon, Bender {\&} Herman (1970) for solving the problem of three dimensional reconstruction from projections in electron microscopy and radiology. This is a deconvolution problem of a particular type: an estimate of a function in a higher dimensional space is deconvolved from its experimentally measured projections to a lower dimensional space. For instance, an x-ray photograph represents the projection of the three-dimensional distribution of x-ray densities within the body onto a two-dimensional plane. A finite number of such photographs taken at different angles allows us to reconstruct an estimate of the original 3-D densities. (Density refers to optical density.) The ART algorithms for solving this problem have a simple intuitive basis. Each projected density is thrown back across the higher dimensional region from whence it came, with repeated corrections to bring each projection of the estimate into agreement with the corresponding measured projection. In order to discuss the ART algorithms, one must first carefully consider the representation of space in digital computers (Sections II and III). Subsequent sections will survey the original ART algorithm (Section IV), convergence criteria (Section V), variations on the ART algorithm (Section VI), reliability of reconstructions (Section VII) and computing efficiency (Section VIII). All symbols used are summarized in Table 1.},

abstract = {An estimated 2{\textperiodcentered}6 million third trimester stillbirths occurred in 2015 (uncertainty range 2{\textperiodcentered}4-3{\textperiodcentered}0 million). The number of stillbirths has reduced more slowly than has maternal mortality or mortality in children younger than 5 years, which were explicitly targeted in the Millennium Development Goals. The Every Newborn Action Plan has the target of 12 or fewer stillbirths per 1000 births in every country by 2030. 94 mainly high-income countries and upper middle-income countries have already met this target, although with noticeable disparities. At least 56 countries, particularly in Africa and in areas aff ected by confl ict, will have to more than double present progress to reach this target. Most (98{\%}) stillbirths are in low-income and middle-income countries. Improved care at birth is essential to prevent 1{\textperiodcentered}3 million (uncertainty range 1{\textperiodcentered}2-1{\textperiodcentered}6 million) intrapartum stillbirths, end preventable maternal and neonatal deaths, and improve child development. Estimates for stillbirth causation are impeded by various classifi cation systems, but for 18 countries with reliable data, congenital abnormalities account for a median of only 7{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} of stillbirths. Many disorders associated with stillbirths are potentially modifi able and often coexist, such as maternal infections (population attributable fraction: malaria 8{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} and syphilis 7{\textperiodcentered}7{\%}), non-communicable diseases, nutrition and lifestyle factors (each about 10{\%}), and maternal age older than 35 years (6{\textperiodcentered}7{\%}). Prolonged pregnancies contribute to 14{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} of stillbirths. Causal pathways for stillbirth frequently involve impaired placental function, either with fetal growth restriction or preterm labour, or both. Two-thirds of newborns have their births registered. However, less than 5{\%} of neonatal deaths and even fewer stillbirths have death registration. Records and registrations of all births, stillbirths, neonatal, and maternal deaths in a health facility would substantially increase data availability. Improved data alone will not save lives but provide a way to target interventions to reach more than 7000 women every day worldwide who experience the reality of stillbirth.},

Pregnant women spend much of that time at home. The aim of this study was to investigate if indoor air pollutants were associated with poor birth outcomes. Pregnant women were recruited prior to 18 weeks gestation. They completed a housing questionnaire and household chemical use survey. Indoor pollutants, formaldehyde (HCHO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), were monitored in the women's homes at 34 weeks gestation. Gestational age (GA), birth weight (BW) and length (BL) and head circumference (HC) were collected from birth records. The associations between measured pollutants, and pollution surrogates, were analysed using general linear models, controlling for maternal age, parity, maternal health, and season of birth. Only HCHO was associated with any of the birth outcomes. There was a 0.044 decrease in BW z-score (p = 0.033) and 0.05 decrease in HC z-score (p = 0.06) for each unit increase in HCHO. Although HCHO concentrations were very low, this finding is consistent with other studies of formaldehyde and poor birth outcomes.},

abstract = {In this paper we revisit observational data concerning RR Lyrae stars in Galactic globular clusters, presenting frequency histograms of fundamentalized periods for the 32 clusters having more than 12 pulsators with well recognized period and pulsation mode. One finds that the range of fundamentalized periods covered by the variables in a given cluster remains fairly constant in varying the cluster metallicity all over the metallicity range spanned by the cluster sample, with the only two exceptions given by M 15 and NGC 6441. We conclude that the width in temperature of the RR Lyrae instability strip appears largely independent of the cluster metallicity. At the same time, it appears that the fundamentalized periods are not affected by the predicted variation of pulsators luminosity with metal abundance, indicating the occurrence of a correlated variation in the pulsator mass. We discuss mean periods in a selected sample of statistically significant ``RR rich" clusters with no less than 10 RRab and 5 RRc variables. One finds a clear evidence for the well known Oosterhoff dichotomy in the mean period {\textless}P{\_}ab{\textgreater} of ab-type variables, together with a similarly clear evidence for a constancy of the mean fundamentalized period {\textless}Pf{\textgreater} in passing from Oosterhoff type II to type I clusters. On this basis, the origin of the Oosterhoff dichotomy is discussed, presenting evidence against a strong dependence of the RR Lyrae luminosity on the metal content. On the contrary, i) the continuity of the mean fundamentalized period, ii) the period frequency histograms in the two prototypes M 3 (type I) and M 15 (type II), iii) the relative abundance of first overtone pulsators, and iv) the observed difference between mean fundamental {\textless}P{\_}ab{\textgreater} and fundamentalized periods {\textless}Pf{\textgreater}, all agree in suggesting the dominant occurrence of a variation in the pulsation mode in a middle region of the instability strip (the ``OR" zone), where variables of Oosterhoff type I and type II clusters are pulsating in the fundamental or first overtone mode, respectively.},

abstract = {The number of applications using optical tomography has significantly increased over the past decade. A literature research providing this term as keyword gives 26 hits for 1990, 719 for 2000, and 9,202 for 2010. With an increasing number of applications, the number of different imaging modalities is also increasing. This review summarizes recent developments in tomographic methods for scattering and nonscattering samples. These two different cases of optical tomography are typically represented by biomedical imaging and atmospheric tomography, representing high- and low-scattering samples, respectively. An essential prerequisite for tomographic analyses is an understanding of light propagation in different media, which allows for the development of specific reconstruction algorithms for the different tomographic tasks.},

abstract = {Forest fire emissions have a strong impact on the concentrations of trace gases and aerosols in the atmosphere. In order to quantify the influence of boreal forest fire emissions on the atmospheric composition, the fire seasons of 1997 and 1998 are compared in this paper. Fire activity in 1998 was very strong, especially over Canada and Eastern Siberia, whereas it was much weaker in 1997. According to burned area estimates the burning in 1998 was more than six times as intense as in 1997. Based on hot spot locations derived from ATSR ( Along Track Scanning Radiometer) data and official burned area data, fire emissions were estimated and their transport was simulated with a Lagrangian tracer transport model. Siberian and Canadian forest fire tracers were distinguished to investigate the transport of both separately. The fire emissions were transported even over intercontinental distances. Due to the El Nino induced meteorological situation, transport from Siberia to Canada was enhanced in 1998. Siberian fire emissions were transported towards Canada and contributed concentrations more than twice as high as those due to Canada's own CO emissions by fires. In 1998 both tracers arrive at higher latitudes over Europe, which is due to a higher North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index in 1998. The simulated emission plumes are compared to CMDL ( Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory) CO(2) and CO data, Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer ( TOMS) aerosol index ( AI) data and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) tropospheric NO(2) and HCHO columns. All the data show clearly enhanced signals during the burning season of 1998 compared to 1997. The results of the model simulation are in good agreement with ground-based as well as satellite-based measurements.},

abstract = {Fire as a natural disaster plays a major role in deforestation; is a major source of trace gases, aerosols and carbon fluxes. Approximately 7 percent of Iran area is covered by forests/and wooded lands. According to the ECE/FAO database on forest/other wooded land fires in Iran (1982-1995), the number of fires per year is 130 and the average area burnt per year is 5400 ha, but fires are not largely monitored and enough detection facilities are not available. The use of remote sensing is now a useful alternative, especially in vast and remote areas. The objective of this paper is to inspect the applicability of using MODIS imagery for forest fire detection in Iran, so a comparative study between a graph-based algorithm proposed by Byun et al. (2005) and two contextual algorithms developed by Giglio et al. (2003) and Wang et al. (2007) using MODIS data acquired over Kerman shah province in summer 2006 is present. The results were compared with ground-based observations collected with GPS. It implies that the algorithm developed by Giglio et al. (2003), MODIS version 4 contextual algorithm, performed best with the least commission and omission errors; has potential to be applied in detecting the fire pixels that start in or around forests and are mainly surface fires and seldom crown fires. As a result, using daily MODIS data, it is possible to track fire development in Iran. 1.},

abstract = {A novel experimental procedure to measure the surface-near distribution of atmospheric trace gases using passive Multi-Axis-Differential Absorption Optical Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) is proposed. The idea consists of pointing the receiving telescope of the spectrometer to non-reflecting surfaces or to 'bright' targets placed at known distances from the measuring device, which are illuminated by sunlight. We show that the partial trace gas absorptions between the top of the atmosphere and the target can be easily removed from the measured total absorption. Thus it is possible to derive the average concentration of trace gases like e.g. NO 2 , HCHO, SO 2 , H 2 O, Glyoxal, BrO and others along the line of sight between the instrument and the target like for the well-known long-path DOAS observations (but with much less expense). If tomographic arrangements are used, even two-or three-dimensional trace gas distributions can be retrieved. The basic assumptions of the proposed method are confirmed by test measurements across the city of Heidelberg.},

abstract = {The role of air pollution in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains uncertain. The aim was to assess the impact of chronic exposure to air pollution on COPD in four cohorts using the standardised ESCAPE exposure estimates. Annual average particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NO x) and road traffic exposure were assigned to home addresses using land-use regression models. COPD was defined by NHANES reference equation (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) less than the lower limit of normal) and the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criterion (FEV1/FVC {\textless}0.70) and categorised by severity in non-asthmatics. We included 6550 subjects with assigned NOx and 3692 with PM measures. COPD was not associated with NO2 or PM10 in any individual cohort. In meta-analyses only NO2, NOx, PM10 and the traffic indicators were positively, although not significantly, associated with COPD. The only statistically significant associations were seen in females (COPD prevalence using GOLD: OR 1.57, 95{\%} CI 1.11-2.23; and incidence: OR 1.79, 95{\%} CI 1.21-2.68). None of the principal results were statistically significant, the weak positive associations of exposure with COPD and the significant subgroup findings need to be evaluated in further well standardised cohorts followed up for longer time, and with time-matched exposure assignments.

abstract = {Understanding motor vehicle emissions, near-roadway pollutant dispersion, and their potential impact to near-roadway populations is an area of growing environmental interest. As part of ongoing U.S. Environmental Protec-tion Agency research in this area, a field study was con-ducted near Interstate 440 (I-440) in Raleigh, NC, in July and August of 2006. This paper presents a subset of mea-surements from the study focusing on nitric oxide (NO) concentrations near the roadway. Measurements of NO in this study were facilitated by the use of a novel path-integrated optical remote sensing technique called deep ultraviolet differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DUV-DOAS). This paper reviews the development and application of this measurement system. Time-resolved near-road NO concentrations are analyzed in conjunction with wind and traffic data to provide a picture of emis-sions and near-road dispersion for the study. Results show peak NO concentrations in the 150 ppb range during weekday morning rush hours with winds from the road accompanied by significantly lower afternoon and week-end concentrations. Traffic volume and wind direction are shown to be primary determinants of NO concentra-tions with turbulent diffusion and meandering account-ing for significant near-road concentrations in off-wind conditions. The enhanced source capture performance of the open-path configuration allowed for robust compari-sons of measured concentrations with a composite vari-able of traffic intensity coupled with wind transport (R 2 ϭ 0.84) as well as investigations on the influence of wind direction on NO dilution near the roadway. The benefits of path-integrated measurements for assessing line source impacts and evaluating models is presented. The advan-tages of NO as a tracer compound, compared with nitro-gen dioxide, for investigations of mobile source emissions and initial dispersion under crosswind conditions are also discussed.},

With an ORS-CT system, two-dimensional maps of chemical concentrations can be created that have good spatial and temporal resolution. The mathematical algorithm used to compute the distribution is critical for accurate and useable reconstructions of the concentrations. In this research, a novel reconstruction method was tested that uses maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) combined with two techniques called grid-translation and multi-grid (GT-MG). To evaluate this method, computer simulations were performed using 120 test maps of varying complexity and a simulated ORS system with four instruments and a total of 40 path-integrated measurements. The results were quantitatively compared with two previously used reconstruction methods (single-grid and grid-translation). Results using the GT-MG method were dramatically improved over previously used methods. Quantitatively, peak exposure errors were reduced by up to 85{\%} and artifacts were dramatically minimized.},

abstract = {Objective: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is one of the most common causes of stillbirths. The objective of this study is to develop a machine learning model that will be able to accurately and consistently predict whether the estimated fetal weight (EFW) will be below the 10th percentile at 34+0–37 + 6 week's gestation stage, by using data collected at 20 + 0 to 23 + 6 weeks gestation. Methods: Recruitment for the prospective Safe Passage Study (SPS) was done over 7.5 years (2007–2015). An essential part of the fetal assessment was the non-invasive transabdominal recording of the maternal and fetal electrocardiograms as well as the performance of an ultrasound examination for Doppler flow velocity waveforms and fetal biometry at 20 + 0 to 23 + 6 and 34 + 0 to 37 + 6 week's gestation. Several predictive models were constructed, using supervised learning techniques, and evaluated using the Stochastic Gradient Descent, k-Nearest Neighbours, Logistic Regression and Random Forest methods. Results: The final model performed exceptionally well across all evaluation metrics, particularly so for the Stochastic Gradient Descent method: achieving a 93{\%} average for Classification Accuracy, Recall, Precision and F1-Score when random sampling is used and 91{\%} for cross-validation (both methods using a 95{\%} confidence interval). Furthermore, the model identifies the Umbilical Artery Pulsality Index to be the strongest identifier for the prediction of IUGR – matching the literature. Three of the four evaluation methods used achieved above 90{\%} for both True Negative and True Positive results. The ROC Analysis showed a very strong True Positive rate (y-axis) for both target attribute outcomes – AUC value of 0.771. Conclusions: The model performs exceptionally well in all evaluation metrics, showing robustness and flexibility as a predictive model for the binary target attribute of IUGR. This accuracy is likely due to the value added by the pre-processed features regarding the fetal gained beats and accelerations, something otherwise absent from previous multi-disciplinary studies. The success of the proposed predictive model allows the pursuit of further birth-related anomalies, providing a foundation for more complex models and lesser-researched subject matter. The data available for this model was a vital part of its success but might also become a limiting factor for further analyses. Further development of similar models could result in better classification performance even with little data available.},

abstract = {We describe the first experimental evaluation of a non-overlapping radial beam geometry to map air pollutants using computed tomography (CT) and optical remote sensing (ORS) instruments. Nitrous oxide was released from a point source inside a 11m longx5.4m wide ventilation chamber. An open path Fourier transform infrared (OP-FTIR) spectrometer gathered path integrated concentration data. The smooth basis function minimization (SBMF) CT algorithm was applied to a radial geometry with 19 rays. Two-dimensional maps were reconstructed from the OP-FTIR measurements and compared with kriged maps calculated from 13-point samples collected simultaneously during the experiments. The CT reconstructions showed good agreement compared to the kriged maps obtained from point samples (concordance correlation factor {\textgreater}0.55). The CT reconstructions also located the peak concentration within 1.2m compared to the point samplers. In contrast to the complex CT beam geometries proposed in the past, the development of this radial scanning configuration could broaden the application of CT to many optical remote sensing instruments.

abstract = {Research in the last several years has indicated that fire size and frequency are on the rise in western U.S. forests. Although fire size and frequency are important, they do not necessarily scale with ecosystem effects of fire, as different ecosystems have different ecological and evolutionary relationships with fire. Our study assessed trends and patterns in fire size and frequency from 1910 to 2008 (all fires {\textgreater} 40 ha), and the percentage of high-severity in fires from 1987 to 2008 (all fires {\textgreater} 400 ha) on the four national forests of northwestern California. During 1910-2008, mean and maximum fire size and total annual area burned increased, but we found no temporal trend in the percentage of high-severity fire during 1987-2008. The time series of severity data was strongly influenced by four years with region-wide lightning events that burned huge areas at primarily low-moderate severity. Regional fire rotation reached a high of 974 years in 1984 and fell to 95 years by 2008. The percentage of high-severity fire in conifer-dominated forests was generally higher in areas dominated by smaller-diameter trees than in areas with larger-diameter trees. For Douglas-fir forests, the percentage of high-severity fire did not differ significantly between areas that re-burned and areas that only burned once (10{\%} vs. 9{\%}) when re-burned within 30 years. Percentage of high-severity fire decreased to 5{\%} when intervals between first and second fires were {\textgreater} 30 years. In contrast, in both mixed-conifer and fir/high-elevation conifer forests, the percentage of high-severity fire was less when re-burned within 30 years compared to first-time burned (12{\%} vs. 16{\%} for mixed conifer; 11{\%} vs. 19{\%} for fir/high-elevation conifer). Additionally, the percentage of high-severity fire did not differ whether the re-burn interval was less than or greater than 30 years. Years with larger fires and greatest area burned were produced by region-wide lightning events, and characterized by less winter and spring precipitation than years dominated by smaller human-ignited fires. Overall percentage of high-severity fire was generally less in years characterized by these region-wide lightning events. Our results suggest that, under certain conditions, wildfires could be more extensively used to achieve ecological and management objectives in northwestern California.},

Written shortly after the passage of the seminal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the third edition was quite timely. Surprisingly, the text has remained relevant for university professors, engineers, scientists, policy makers and students up to recent years. However, in light of the transition in the last five years from predominantly technology-based standards (maximum achievable control technologies or MACTs) to risk-based regulations and air quality standards, the text must be updated significantly. The fourth edition will be updated to include numerous MACTs which were not foreseen during the writing of the third edition, such as secondary lead (Pb) smelting, petroleum refining, aerospace manufacturing, marine vessel loading, ship building, printing and publishing, elastomer production, offsite waste operations, and polyethylene terephthalate polymer and styrene-based thermoplastic polymers production.

abstract = {Objective: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is one of the most common causes of stillbirths. The objective of this study is to develop a machine learning model that will be able to accurately and consistently predict whether the estimated fetal weight (EFW) will be below the 10th percentile at 34+0–37 + 6 week's gestation stage, by using data collected at 20 + 0 to 23 + 6 weeks gestation. Methods: Recruitment for the prospective Safe Passage Study (SPS) was done over 7.5 years (2007–2015). An essential part of the fetal assessment was the non-invasive transabdominal recording of the maternal and fetal electrocardiograms as well as the performance of an ultrasound examination for Doppler flow velocity waveforms and fetal biometry at 20 + 0 to 23 + 6 and 34 + 0 to 37 + 6 week's gestation. Several predictive models were constructed, using supervised learning techniques, and evaluated using the Stochastic Gradient Descent, k-Nearest Neighbours, Logistic Regression and Random Forest methods. Results: The final model performed exceptionally well across all evaluation metrics, particularly so for the Stochastic Gradient Descent method: achieving a 93{\%} average for Classification Accuracy, Recall, Precision and F1-Score when random sampling is used and 91{\%} for cross-validation (both methods using a 95{\%} confidence interval). Furthermore, the model identifies the Umbilical Artery Pulsality Index to be the strongest identifier for the prediction of IUGR – matching the literature. Three of the four evaluation methods used achieved above 90{\%} for both True Negative and True Positive results. The ROC Analysis showed a very strong True Positive rate (y-axis) for both target attribute outcomes – AUC value of 0.771. Conclusions: The model performs exceptionally well in all evaluation metrics, showing robustness and flexibility as a predictive model for the binary target attribute of IUGR. This accuracy is likely due to the value added by the pre-processed features regarding the fetal gained beats and accelerations, something otherwise absent from previous multi-disciplinary studies. The success of the proposed predictive model allows the pursuit of further birth-related anomalies, providing a foundation for more complex models and lesser-researched subject matter. The data available for this model was a vital part of its success but might also become a limiting factor for further analyses. Further development of similar models could result in better classification performance even with little data available.},

abstract = {Objectives: Our aim was to study the possible associations between exposure to elevated levels of air pollution, ozone (O3) and vehicle exhaust (NOx), during early gestation, and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as pre-eclampsia, preterm birth and small for gestational age. Design: Prospective register-based cohort study. Setting: The Swedish Medical Birth Register includes data on all deliveries during 1998 to 2006 in Greater Stockholm, Sweden. The national Patient Register and the Prescribed Drug Register were used to collect information on maternal asthma. Participants: All singleton pregnancies, conceived at the earliest in August 1997 and at the latest in February 2006, were included, n=120 755. Outcome measures: We studied preterm birth, small for gestational age and pre-eclampsia. Results: 4.4{\%} of pregnancies resulted in a preterm birth. The prevalence of pre-eclampsia was 2.7{\%}. We observed an association between first trimester O3 and preterm birth (OR 1.04, 95{\%} CI 1.01 to 1.08) as well as an association with pre-eclampsia (OR 1.04, 95{\%} CI 1.01 to 1.08), per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in O3. We observed no association between first trimester NOx and adverse pregnancy outcomes. No associations were observed between any of the air pollutants and small for gestational age. Conclusions: Increased levels of O3 during the first trimester increased the risk of pre-eclampsia and preterm birth. Air pollutants did not exhibit any effects on fetal growth restriction. We estimated 1 in every 20 cases of pre-eclampsia to be associated with O3 exposure.},

We examine the numerous potentialities of minor gas slant column calculations, applying the «off-axis» methodology for collecting the diffuse solar radiation. One of these particular approaches, using measurements along horizontal paths, has already been tested with the spectrometer installed on board the Geophysica aircraft during stratospheric flights up to altitudes of 20 km. The theoretical basis of these new measurement techniques using DOAS remote sensing systems are delineated to assess whether low altitude flights can provide 2D and 3D pollution tomography over metropolitan areas. The 2D or 3D trace gas total column mapping could be used to investigate: i) transport and dispersion phenomena of air pollution, ii) photochemical process rates, iii) gas plume tomography, iv) minor gas vertical profiles into the Planetary Boundary Layer and v) minor gas flux divergence over a large area.},

abstract = {Limb measurements provided by the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectrometer for Atmospheric CHartog-raphY (SCIAMACHY) on the ENVISAT satellite allow re-trieving stratospheric profiles of various trace gases on a global scale, among them BrO for the first time. For limb observations in the UV/VIS spectral region the instrument measures scattered light with a complex distribution of light paths: the light is measured at different tangent heights and can be scattered or absorbed in the atmosphere or reflected by the ground. By means of spectroscopy and radiative transfer modelling these measurements can be inverted to retrieve the vertical distribution of stratospheric trace gases. The fully spherical 3-D Monte Carlo radiative transfer model " Tracy-II " is applied in this study. The Monte Carlo method benefits from conceptual simplicity and allows re-alizing the concept of full spherical geometry of the atmo-sphere and also its 3-D properties, which is important for a realistic description of the limb geometry. Furthermore it al-lows accounting for horizontal gradients in the distribution of trace gases. In this study the effect of horizontally inhomogeneous dis-tributions of trace gases along flight/viewing direction on the retrieval of profiles is investigated. We introduce a tomo-graphic method to correct for this effect by combining con-secutive limb scanning sequences and utilizing the overlap in their measurement sensitivity regions. It is found that if hor-izontal inhomogenity is not properly accounted for, typical errors of 20{\%} for NO 2 and up to 50{\%} for OClO around the altitude of the profile peak can arise for measurements close to the Arctic polar vortex boundary in boreal winter.},

The new method, called CAT-4Dvar, combines Computer Aided Tomography (CAT) and 4D variational (4Dvar) data assimilation. The objective of the method is to produce accurate reconstructions compared to the Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) and other non-variational methods with only a small number of DOAS telescopes. A forward and adjoint 3D grid dispersion model was developed based on advection and diffusion solvers commonly used in air quality modeling. The adjoint model optimizes the model emissions and horizontal diffusion coefficient based on the difference between tomographic DOAS observations and ray path-integrated concentrations predicted by the forward model. It also updates the corresponding error covariances based on the Hessian of the cost function. An enhanced reconstruction is obtained from the forward model with optimized parameter values. In a synthetic experiment involving two hypothetical DOAS instruments, the CAT-4Dvar method yielded excellent results compared to ART, reducing the overall nearness index from 57{\%} to 11{\%}. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The procedure consists of pointing the receiving telescope of the spectrometer to nonreflecting surfaces or to bright targets placed at known distances from the measuring device, which are illuminated by sunlight. We show that the partial trace gas absorptions between the top of the atmosphere and the target can be easily removed from the measured total absorption. Thus it is possible to derive the average concentration of trace gases such as NO(2), HCHO, SO(2), H(2)O, Glyoxal, BrO, and others along the line of sight between the instrument and the target similar to the well-known long-path DOAS observations (but with much less expense). If tomographic arrangements are used, even two- or three-dimensional trace gas distributions can be retrieved. The basic assumptions of the proposed method are confirmed by test measurements taken across the city of Heidelberg.},

The retrieval of information on the vertical profile of trace gases from their slant column amounts requires: (1) the simulation of the radiative transfer in the atmosphere for Air Mass Factor (AMF) calculation; (2) the application of inversion schemes. In this paper the vertical profiles of NO 2 and O 3 obtained from multiple axis DOAS measurements and their daily evolution are presented and discussed. The day under study is the 29 th of October, 2006.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors.Forest measurement for purposes like harvesting planning, biomass estimation and mitigating climate change through carbon capture by forests call for increasingly frequent forest measurement campaigns that need to balance cost with accuracy and precision. Often this implies the use of remote sensing based measurement methods. For any remote-sensing based methods to be accurate, they must be validated against field data. We present a method that combines field measurements with two layers of remote sensing data: sampling of forests by airborne laser scanning (LiDAR) and Landsat imagery. The Bayesian model-based framework presented here is called Lidar-Assisted Multi-source Programme-or LAMP-for Above Ground Biomass estimation. The method has two variants: LAMP2 which splits the biomass estimation task into two separate stages: forest type stratification from Landsat imagery and mean biomass density estimation of each forest type by LiDAR models calibrated on field plots. LAMP3, on the other hand, estimates first the biomass on a LiDAR sample using models calibrated with field plots and then uses these LiDAR-based models to generate biomass density estimates on thousands of surrogate plots, with which a satellite image based model is calibrated and subsequently used to estimate biomass density on the entire forest area. Both LAMP methods have been applied to a 2 million hectare area in Southern Nepal, the Terai Arc Landscape or TAL to calculate the emission Reference Levels (RLs) that are required for the UN REDD+ program that was accepted as part of the Paris Climate Agreement. The uncertainty of these estimates is studied with error variance estimation, cross-validation and Monte Carlo simulation. The relative accuracy of activity data at pixel level was found to be 14 per cent at 95 per cent confidence level and the root mean squared error of biomass estimates to be between 35 and 39 per cent at 1 ha resolution.},

abstract = {Although deep learning has produced dazzling successes for applications of image, speech, and video processing in the past few years, most trainings are with suboptimal hyper-parameters, requiring unnecessarily long training times. Setting the hyper-parameters remains a black art that requires years of experience to acquire. This report proposes several efficient ways to set the hyper-parameters that significantly reduce training time and improves performance. Specifically, this report shows how to examine the training validation/test loss function for subtle clues of underfitting and overfitting and suggests guidelines for moving toward the optimal balance point. Then it discusses how to increase/decrease the learning rate/momentum to speed up training. Our experiments show that it is crucial to balance every manner of regularization for each dataset and architecture. Weight decay is used as a sample regularizer to show how its optimal value is tightly coupled with the learning rates and momentums. Files to help replicate the results reported here are available.},

@article{Miller2016,
abstract = {Background The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists places special emphasis on autopsy as one of the most important tests for evaluation of stillbirth. Despite a recommendation of an autopsy, many families will decline the autopsy based on religious/cultural beliefs, fear of additional suffering for the child, or belief that no additional information will be obtained or of value. Further, many obstetric providers express a myriad of barriers limiting their recommendation for a perinatal autopsy despite their understanding of its value. Consequently, perinatal autopsy rates have been declining. Without the information provided by an autopsy, many women are left with unanswered questions regarding cause of death for their fetus and without clear management strategies to reduce the risk of stillbirth in future pregnancies. To avoid this scenario, it is imperative that clinicians are knowledgeable about the benefit of autopsy so they can provide clear information on its diagnostic utility and decrease potential barriers; in so doing the obstetrician can ensure that each family has the necessary information to make an informed decision. Objective We sought to quantify the contribution of placental pathologic examination and autopsy in identifying a cause of stillbirth and to identify how often clinical management is modified due to each result. Study Design This is a cohort study of all cases of stillbirth from 2009 through 2013 at a single tertiary care center. Records were reviewed in a stepwise manner: first the clinical history and laboratory results, then the placental pathologic evaluation, and finally the autopsy. At each step, a cause of death and the certainty of that etiology were coded. Clinical changes that would be recommended by information available at each step were also recorded. Results Among the 144 cases of stillbirth examined, 104 (72{\%}) underwent autopsy and these cases constitute the cohort of study. The clinical and laboratory information alone identified a cause of death in 35 (24{\%}). After placental pathologic examination, 88 (61{\%}) cases had a probable cause of death identified. The addition of autopsy resulted in 78 (74{\%}) cases having an identifiable probable cause of death. Placental examination alone changed clinical management in 52 (36{\%}) cases. Autopsy led to additional clinical management changes in 6 (6{\%}) cases. Conclusion This stepwise assessment of the benefit of both placental pathological examination and autopsy in changing probable cause of death beyond traditional clinical history and laboratory results emphasizes the need to implement more comprehensive evaluation of all stillbirths. With the aim of providing a cause of stillbirth to the parents, and to prevent future stillbirths, it behooves health care professionals to understand the value of this more comprehensive approach and convey that information to the bereaved parents.},

Indeed, FGR or small-for-gestational age fetus (SGA) is a major risk factor for stillbirth. In rare cases, this is due to genetic abnormalities or infections. However, in most cases, it is linked to placental insufficiency. This may be due to abnormal placental development or placental damage, thereby resulting in decreased blood flow, oxygen, and nutrients to the fetus. Several placental histological abnormalities are associated with stillbirth, FGR, or both. Most involve vascular abnormalities but some are inflammatory lesions. This paper reviews evidence regarding the relationships between placental function and pathology, FGR, and stillbirth. Issues with clinical relevance, knowledge gaps, and areas for further research are highlighted.},

abstract = {In this study, we theoretically investigate the re-construction of 2-D cross sections through Gaussian concen-tration distributions, e.g. emission plumes, from long path DOAS measurements along a limited number of light paths. This is done systematically with respect to the extension of the up to four peaks and for six different measurement setups with 2–4 telescopes and 36 light paths each. We distinguish between cases with and without additional background con-centrations. Our approach parametrises the unknown distri-bution by local piecewise constant or linear functions on a regular grid and solves the resulting discrete, linear system by a least squares minimum norm principle. We show that the linear parametrisation not only allows better representa-tion of the distributions in terms of discretisation errors, but also better inversion of the system. We calculate area inte-grals of the concentration field (i.e. total emissions rates for non-vanishing perpendicular wind speed components) and show that reconstruction errors and reconstructed area inte-grals within the peaks for narrow distributions crucially de-pend on the resolution of the reconstruction grid. A recently suggested grid translation method for the piecewise con-stant basis functions, combining reconstructions from sev-eral shifted grids, is modified for the linear basis functions and proven to reduce overall reconstruction errors, but not the uncertainty of concentration integrals. We suggest a pro-cedure to subtract additional background concentration fields before inversion. We find large differences in reconstruction quality between the geometries and conclude that, in general, for a constant number of light paths increasing the number of telescopes leads to better reconstruction results. It ap-pears that geometries that give better results for negligible measurement errors and parts of the geometry that are better resolved are also less sensitive to increasing measurement er-rors.},

abstract = {It is widely accepted that software measures provide an appropriate mechanism for understanding, monitoring, controlling, and predicting the quality of software development projects. In software product lines (SPL), quality is even more important than in a single software product since, owing to systematic reuse, a fault or an inadequate design decision could be propagated to several products in the family. Over the last few years, a great number of quality attributes and measures for assessing the quality of SPL have been reported in literature. However, no studies summarizing the current knowledge about them exist. This paper presents a systematic literature review with the objective of identifying and interpreting all the available studies from 1996 to 2010 that present quality attributes and/or measures for SPL. These attributes and measures have been classified using a set of criteria that includes the life cycle phase in which the measures are applied; the corresponding quality characteristics; their support for specific SPL characteristics (e.g., variability, compositionality); the procedure used to validate the measures, etc. We found 165 measures related to 97 different quality attributes. The results of the review indicated that 92{\%} of the measures evaluate attributes that are related to maintainability. In addition, 67{\%} of the measures are used during the design phase of Domain Engineering, and 56{\%} are applied to evaluate the product line architecture. However, only 25{\%} of them have been empirically validated. In conclusion, the results provide a global vision of the state of the research within this area in order to help researchers in detecting weaknesses, directing research efforts, and identifying new research lines. In particular, there is a need for new measures with which to evaluate both the quality of the artifacts produced during the entire SPL life cycle and other quality characteristics. There is also a need for more validation (both theoretical and empirical) of existing measures. In addition, our results may be useful as a reference guide for practitioners to assist them in the selection or the adaptation of existing measures for evaluating their software product lines.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate cardiovascular mortality (CVM) attributed to CO levels in Ahvaz, Bushehr and Kermanshah, as the major cities in south western of Iran, with population of 2000000 people during 2013? The measured CO data in 2013 by 10 monitoring stations were used in this study. CO data, temperature and pressure were collected through Ahvaz, Bushehr and Kermanshah Meteorological Organization and Iranian Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Then, these data were processed by Excel software through correcting temperature and pressure, encode, averaging and filtering. Finally, all data were processed to make input file of Air Q model. The results showed that the maximum and the minimum concentration of CO were associated with Ahvaz and Bushehr with annual averages of 8.51 and 3.76 mg/m3, respectively. This could be due to higher fuel consumption gasoline in vehicles in Ahvaz in comparison with Kermanshah and Bushehr. Cardiovascular mortality during 2013 which was attributed to CO in Ahvaz, Bushehr and Kermanshah were 15, 10 and 3 cases, respectively.

In the maximum likelihood approach these parameters are estimated by maximizing the likelihood (probability of the observations). EM algorithms are iterative techniques for finding maximum likelihood estimates. In this paper we discuss the general principles behind all EM algorithms and derive in detail the specific algorithms for emission and transmission tomography. The virtues of the EM algorithms include (a) accurate incorporation of a good physical model, (b) automatic inclusion of non-negativity constraints on all parameters, (c) an excellent measure of the quality of a reconstruction, and (d) global convergence to a single vector of parameter estimates. We discuss the specification of necessary physical features such as source and detector geometries. Actual reconstructions are deferred to a later time.},

The ESG were developed to meet the need for a common understanding of quality assurance in European higher education. The FQEHEA was developed to meet the need for a common understanding of the generic learning outcomes that signified completion of each of the three cycles of higher education.

abstract = {7 Executive summary Air quality in Europe — 2017 report Executive summary Air pollution is a key environmental and social issue and, at the same time, it is a complex problem posing multiple challenges in terms of management and mitigation of harmful pollutants. Air pollutants are emitted from anthropogenic and natural sources; they may be either emitted directly (primary pollutants) or formed in the atmosphere (as secondary pollutants). They have a number of impacts on health, ecosystems, the built environment and the climate; they may be transported or formed over long distances; and they may affect large areas. Effective action to reduce the impacts of air pollution requires a good understanding of its causes, how pollutants are transported and transformed in the atmosphere, and how they affect humans, ecosystems, the climate, and subsequently society and the economy. The current report presents an updated overview and analysis of air quality in Europe from 2000 to 2015. It reviews the progress made towards meeting the air quality standards established in the two European Ambient Air Quality Directives, and towards the long-term objectives of achieving levels of air pollution that do not lead to unacceptable harm to human health and the environment. It also presents the latest findings and estimates on population and ecosystem exposure to the air pollutants with the greatest impacts and effects on human health and the environment (Box ES.1). The evaluation of the status of air quality is based mainly on ambient air measurements, in conjunction with data on anthropogenic emissions and their evolution over time. Air quality policies have delivered, and continue to deliver, many improvements. Reduced emissions have improved air quality in Europe, and, for a number of pollutants, exceedances of European standards are rare. However, substantial challenges remain and considerable impacts on human health and on the environment persist. A large proportion of European populations and ecosystems are still exposed to air pollution that exceeds European standards and, especially, the World Health Organization (WHO) Air Quality Guidelines (AQGs). Effective air quality policies require action and cooperation at global, European, national and local levels, which must reach across most economic sectors and engage the public. Holistic solutions must be found that involve technological development and structural and behavioural changes. These will be necessary to achieve human wellbeing and social development, to protect the natural capital and to support economic prosperity, all of which are part of the European Union's (EU) 2050 vision of living well within the limits of the planet.},

abstract = {The easyPET scanner has an innovative design, comprising only two array columns facing each other, and with an actuation defined by two rotation axes. Using this design, two approaches have been taken. The first concerns to a didactic PET scanner, where the arrays of detectors are comprised of only one detector each, and it is meant to be a simple 2-dimensional PET scanner for educational purposes. The second corresponds to a pre-clinical scanner, with the arrays having multiple detectors, meant to acquire 3-dimensional data. Given the geometry of the system, there is no concern with the effects of not measuring the Depth-of-Interaction (DOI), and a resolution of 1-1.5 mm is expected with the didactic system, improving with the pre-clinical. The work presented in this thesis deals with 2D image reconstruction for the easyPET scanners. The unconventional nature of the acquisition geometry, the large amount of data to be processed, the complexity of implementing a PET image reconstruction algorithm, and the implementation of data regularization methods, gaussian filtering and Median Root Prior (MRP), were addressed in this thesis. For this, the Matlab software was used to implement the ML-EM algorithm. Alongside, several optimizations were also implemented in order to convey a better computational performance to the algorithm. These optimizations refer to using geometry symmetries and fast indexing approaches. Moreover, a user interface was created so as to enhance the user experience for the didactic easyPET system. The validation of the implemented algorithm was performed using Monte Carlo simulated, and acquired data. The first results obtained indicate that the optimizations implemented on the algorithm have successfully reduced the image reconstruction time. On top of that, the system was tested according to the NEMA rules. A comparison was then made between reconstructed images produced by using Filtered Back Projection (FBP), the native ML-EM implementation, the ML-EM algorithm using inter- iteration gaussian filtering, and the ML-EM algorithm implemented with the MRP. This comparison was made through the calculation of FWHM, FWTM, and SNR, at different spatial positions. The results obtained reveal an approximate 1.5x 1.5 mm2 FWHM source resolution in the FOV, when recurring to FBP, and 1.2x 1.2 mm2 for the native ML-EM algorithm. The implemented data regularization methods produced similar or improved spatial resolution results, whilst improving the source's SNR values. The results obtained show the potential in the easyPET systems. Since the didactic scanner is already on its final stage, the next step will be to further test the pre-clinical system},

This novel technique serves to measure 2-3-dimensional concentration fields of different trace gases (e.g. NO 2, SO 2, ozone) in the planetary boundary layer on a small scale (100-10 000 m) by the use of multiple light paths. Ways to use telescopes, lamps, retroreflector arrays and spectrometers for the simultaneous measurement of many light-paths are proposed. The results from a first Long-path Tom-DOAS experiment next to a German motorway, which was part of the BAB II campaign April/May 2001 [Edition of the Institut f??r Meteorologie und Klimaforschung, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe/Universit??t Karlsruhe, pp. 45, 2001), are presented. From the measurements along 16 different light paths vertical profiles on both sides of the motorway as well as a two-dimensional map of the NO 2 vehicle emission plume are derived.

abstract = {In this paper, we developed an analytical fan-beam reconstruction algorithm that compensates for uniform attenuation in SPECT. The new fan-beam algorithm is in the form of backprojection first, then filtering, and is mathematically exact. The algorithm is based on three components. The first one is the established generalized central-slice theorem, which relates the 1D Fourier transform of a set of arbitrary data and the 2D Fourier transform of the backprojected image. The second one is the fact that the backprojection of the fan-beam measurements is identical to the backprojection of the parallel measurements of the same object with the same attenuator. The third one is the stable analytical reconstruction algorithm for uniformly attenuated Radon data, developed by Metz and Pan. The fan-beam algorithm is then extended into a cone-beam reconstruction algorithm, where the orbit of the focal point of the cone-beam imaging geometry is a circle. This orbit geometry does not satisfy Tuy's condition and the obtained cone-beam algorithm is an approximation. In the cone-beam algorithm, the cone-beam data are first backprojected into the 3D image volume; then a slice-by-slice filtering is performed. This slice-by-slice filtering procedure is identical to that of the fan-beam algorithm. Both the fan-beam and cone-beam algorithms are efficient, and computer simulations are presented. The new cone-beam algorithm is compared with Bronnikov's cone-beam algorithm, and it is shown to have better performance with noisy projections.},

abstract = {Differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) is a useful technique for measuring nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and aerosol, the most important species in urban environmental pollution. This pa-per reports on the results of our dual path DOAS measurements recently conducted in Chiba City, Japan, using xenon flashlights equipped on tall constructions as aviation obstruction lights. Be-cause of the proximity of the southern DOAS path to an industrial area, it is found that the level of air pollution generally increases with the dominance of westerly winds, from the plausible source area to the observation light path. This situation is consistent with the result of wind lidar mea-surement covering a sector of ±28ith the observation range of approximately 2.8 km. In spite of the fact that the two DOAS paths, having path lengths of 5.5 and 3.5 km each, are located in sepa-rated regions of Chiba City, the observed temporal behavior was similar for both nitrogen dioxide and aerosol, though the southern path tends to exhibit slightly higher pollution levels than the northern counterpart. Additionally it is confirmed that size information of aerosol particles can be derived from the DOAS data through the analysis of the wavelength dependence of the aerosol optical thickness, which shows fairly good correlation with the mass ratio between PM2.5 and suspended particulate matter (SPM) obtained from the in-situ sampling station measurement. Thus, the DOAS approach can also be utilized for obtaining information on PM2.5 that is consi-dered to be more harmful to human health than SPM. H. Saito et al.},

abstract = {Despite near-universal commitments to end child marriage, one in three girls in developing countries (excluding China) will probably be married before they are 18. One out of nine girls will be married before their 15th birthday. Most of these girls are poor, less-educated, and living in rural areas. Over 67 million women 20-24 year old in 2010 had been married as girls. Half were in Asia, one-fifth in Africa. In the next decade 14.2 million girls under 18 will be married every year; this translates into 39,000 girls married each day. This will rise to an average of 15.1 million girls a year, starting in 2021 until 2030, if present trends continue. While child marriages are declining among girls under age 15, 50 million girls could still be at risk of being married before their 15th birthday in this decade. While most countries allow girls to marry before they turn 18 with parental or other consent, poverty often underlies child marriage. Humanitarian crises exacerbate girls' vulnerability. Some parents genuinely believe that marriage will secure their daughters' future, while others see their daughters as a burden or even a commodity. Child marriage stands in the way of ensuring that girls have healthy and productive lives. Child marriage directly threatens health and wellbeing: complications from pregnancy and childbirth together are the main cause of death among adolescent girls 15-19 in developing countries. Reaching puberty should mark the beginning of a gradual transition to a healthy and productive adulthood. Instead, for many girls, puberty marks an accelerating trajectory into inequality. Child marriage is a primary source of this, curtailing a critical period for growth, learning, identity formation and experimentation: each of which is essential if maturation into fully rounded human beings is to be unhindered. International conventions declare that child marriage is a violation of human rights because it denies girls the right to decide when and with whom to marry. This report is intended to help policymakers prevent this violation of girls' rights. It summarizes available data and evidence, while offering advice on the thicket of issues involved, and suggests prioritized actions to reduce and eventually eliminate child marriage. If nothing changes, developing countries will witness an increase in child marriage: 142 million child marriages in 2011-2020 and 151 million in the subsequent decade. As the numbers of girls who are married as children grows, the numbers of children bearing children will increase and deaths among girls will rise. Given the time lag in the impacts of changing population dynamics, even a reduced rate of child marriage, will mean that absolute numbers may grow for some time ahead. It is urgent therefore that social norms that serve to legitimate child marriage change. These can and do start to change, once parents and communities understand the harm that child marriage does and once they are able to identify alternatives that discourage and eventually will end the practice. Promising strategies for change are in evidence but they need more investment. Ending child marriage will help countries reach the Millennium Development Goals, and should be a high priority in the post-2015 development agenda. Each country should collect and analyze its own data to help target geographic “hotspot” areas where high proportions and numbers of girls are at risk. Policies and programmes should be designed accordingly. Policies are needed across sectors to delay marriage, including raising the legal minimum age at marriage to 18, ensuring that girls go to school and attend beyond primary level, addressing underlying factors perpetuating the practice, identifying alternatives and creating opportunities for girls, and reaching out to communities to support these moves. Girls need, education, health, social and livelihood skills to become fully empowered citizens. Most immediately important is helping already married girls to avoid early pregnancy and when pregnant have access to appropriate care during pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum (including access to family planning).},

abstract = {For some years now, UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) are commonly used for different mobile mapping applications, such as in the fields of surveying, mining or archeology. To improve the efficiency of these applications an automation of the flight as well as the processing of the collected data is currently aimed at. One precondition for an automated mapping with UAVs is that the georeferencing is performed directly with cm-accuracies or better. Usually, a cm-accurate direct positioning of UAVs is based on an onboard multi-sensor system, which consists of an RTK-capable (real-time kinematic) GPS (global positioning system) receiver and additional sensors (e.g. inertial sensors). In this case, the absolute positioning accuracy essentially depends on the local GPS measurement conditions. Especially during mobile mapping applications in urban areas, these conditions can be very challenging, due to a satellite shadowing, non-line-of sight receptions, signal diffraction or multipath effects. In this paper, two straightforward and easy to implement strategies will be described and analyzed, which improve the direct positioning accuracies for UAV-based mapping and surveying applications under challenging GPS measurement conditions. Based on a 3D model of the surrounding buildings and vegetation in the area of interest, a GPS geometry map is determined, which can be integrated in the flight planning process, to avoid GPS challenging environments as far as possible. If these challenging environments cannot be avoided, the GPS positioning solution is improved by using obstruction adaptive elevation masks, to mitigate systematic GPS errors in the RTK-GPS positioning. Simulations and results of field tests demonstrate the profit of both strategies.},

With an ORS-CT system, two-dimensional maps of chemical concentrations can be created that have good spatial and temporal resolution. The mathematical algorithm used to compute the distribution is critical for accurate and useable reconstructions of the concentrations. In this research, a novel reconstruction method was tested that uses maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) combined with two techniques called grid-translation and multi-grid (GT-MG). To evaluate this method, computer simulations were performed using 120 test maps of varying complexity and a simulated ORS system with four instruments and a total of 40 path-integrated measurements. The results were quantitatively compared with two previously used reconstruction methods (single-grid and grid-translation). Results using the GT-MG method were dramatically improved over previously used methods. Quantitatively, peak exposure errors were reduced by up to 85{\%} and artifacts were dramatically minimized. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Since X-ray tomography is now widely adopted in many different areas, it becomes more crucial to find a robust routine of handling tomographic data to get quality reconstructed images. Though there are several existing techniques, it seems helpful to have a more automated method to remove the possible errors that hinder clearer image reconstruction. Here, we proposed an alternative method and new algorithm using the sinogram and the fixed point. A new physical concept of Center of Attenuation (CA) was also introduced to figure out how this fixed point is applied to the image reconstruction with errors we further categorized. Our technique showed a promising performance in restoring images with translation and vertical tilt errors.},

abstract = {The timing of the human control of fire is a hotly debated issue, with claims for regular fire use by early hominins in Africa at -1.6 million y ago. These claims are not uncontested, but most archae- ologists would agree that the colonization of areas outside Africa, especially of regions such as Europe where temperatures at time dropped below freezing, was indeed tied to the use of fire. Our review of the European evidence suggests that early hominins moved into northern latitudes without the habitual use of fire. It was only much later, from -300,000 to 400,000 y ago onward, that fire became a significant part of the hominin technological reper- toire. It is also from the second half of the Middle Pleistocene onward that we can observe spectacular cases of Neandertal pyro- technological knowledge in the production of hafting materials. The increase in the number of sites with good evidence of fire throughout the Late Pleistocene shows that European Neandertals had fire management not unlike that documented for Upper Paleolithic groups.},

The experiment was conducted over an area of 10 m {\^{A}} 15 m using one and two cylindrical polycarbonate containers of diameter 2 m, respectively, filled with NO 2 . The setup was realized with three of the multibeam instruments recently developed by Pundt and Mettendorf (Appl. Opt., 2005, in press), 1 which allow the simultaneous measurement along at least four light paths each. The configuration consisted of twelve simultaneous light beams, 39 horizontal light paths in total, and 18 different cylinder positions inside the field. It was found that for the discretization and inversion technique shown here reconstructions of the concentration distributions from experimental data agree well with simulated reconstructions. In order to draw conclusions for atmospheric applications, numerical studies including instrumental errors were carried out. It was found that with the presented measurement setup it is possible to measure and reconstruct one or two NO 2 plumes of 600 m diameter and average concentrations above 4.2 ppbv each, on a scale of 13.5 km 2 . Theoretical investigations show that it should be possible to localize and quantify 600 m diameter plumes of SO 2 4 1.5 ppbv, H 2 CO 4 6.3 ppbv, HONO 4 3.2 ppbv, and ozone 4 46.2 ppbv. Larger plumes can be measured with higher precision.},

abstract = {Air pollution represents the biggest environ- mental risk to health. In 2012, one out of every nine deaths was the result of air pollution-rela- ted conditions. Of those deaths, around 3 mil- lion are attributable solely to ambient (outdoor) air pollution. Air pollution affects all regions, settings, socioeconomic groups, and age groups. While all people living in a given area breathe from the same air, there are never- theless important geographical differences in exposure to air pollution. Citizens in Africa, Asia or the Middle East breathe much higher levels of air pollutants that those in living other parts of the world. Some places have air pollution levels that are several times higher than those consi- dered safe by the World Health Organization (WHO) Air quality guidelines. Air pollution is used as a marker of sustai- nable development, as sources of air pollu- tion also produce climate-modifying pollutants (e.g. CO2 or black carbon). Policies to address air pollution also generate a range of bene- fits to human health, not only through air quality improvements but also other health benefits, such as injury prevention or enabling physical activity. Consequently, concerns about air pollution are reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) : Air pollution levels in cities is cited as an indicator for urban sustainable development (SDG 11) ; access to clean energy – particular- ly clean household fuels and technologies – is highlighted as an indicator for sustainable en- ergy (SDG 7) ; and mortality due to air pollution (ambient and household) is used an indicator for the health SDG goal (SDG 3). Reliable estimates of exposure to and impacts from air pollutants are key to better inform policy-makers, as well as development partners. These figures are neces- sary to track progress in air quality improvements and to help evaluate the effectiveness of policies aiming at reducing air pollution, as well as as- sessment of how much they are contributing to protect health. In 2015, to respond to this major global public health threat, the 194 WHO Member States adop- ted the first World Health Assembly resolution to “ address the adverse health effects of air pollu- tion ”. The following year, Member States agreed on a road map for “ an enhanced global response to the adverse health effects of air pollution ”. Among the main elements of this road map are the monitoring and reporting of air pollution, and enhanced systems, structures and processes for monitoring and reporting health trends asso- ciated with air pollution and its sources. The current report presents methods and data for two of the SDG indicators reported by WHO : {\textperiodcentered} SDG Indicator 11.6.2 : Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5 ) in cities (population-weighted) ; and {\textperiodcentered} SDG Indicator 3.9.1 : Mortality rate attribu- ted to household and ambient air pollution. This report presents the updated results of morta- lity and morbidity attributed to ambient air pollu- tion (also known as ‘ burden of disease due to air pollution '). It includes information on the sources of data on air pollution available to the WHO, on the methodology used to estimate human exposure to air pollution and related burden of disease, as well as the actual estimates of human exposure to particulate matter of a diameter less than 2.5 micrometres (PM2.5 ) for countries and for the globe ; and the related national burden of disease attributable to long-term exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution for the year 2012. The global exposure assessment to air pollu- tion consists of modelled data of population- weighted annual mean PM2.5 concentrations. Data are modelled through combining remote satellite sensing data with ground measure- ments from the 2016 WHO ambient (outdoor) air quality database, which serves for calibration of the satellite data},

abstract = {Objective: To quantify how the changing stillbirth risk profile of women is affecting the interpretation of the stillbirth rate. Design: A retrospective, population-based cohort study from 1983 to 2018. Setting: Victoria, Australia. Population: A total of 2 419 923 births at ≥28 weeks of gestation. Methods: Changes in maternal characteristics over time were assessed. A multivariable logistic regression model was developed for stillbirth, based on maternal characteristics in 1983–1987, and used to calculate individual predictive probabilities of stillbirth from the regression equation. The number of expected stillbirths per year as a result of the change in maternal demographics was then calculated, assuming no changes in care and in the associations between maternal characteristics and stillbirth over time. Main outcome measure: Stillbirth. Results: Compared with 1983–1987, there were more women in older age groups giving birth, more nulliparous women, more indigenous women and women born in Oceania, Asia and Africa, more multiple pregnancies and more women with pre-existing diabetes in 2014–2018. Despite this, the rate of stillbirth fell from 5.42 per 1000 births in 1983 to 1.72 per 1000 births in 2018 (P {\textless} 0.001). Applying the multivariable logistic regression equation, derived from the 1983–87 data, to each year, had there been no changes in care or in the associations between maternal characteristics and stillbirth, the rate of stillbirth would have increased by 12{\%}, from 4.94 per 1000 in 1983 to 5.54 per 1000 in 2018, as a result of the change in maternal characteristics. Conclusions: Population rates of stillbirth are falling faster than is generally appreciated. Tweetable abstract: Population reductions in stillbirth have been underestimated as a result of changing maternal characteristics.},

abstract = {A breadboard demonstrator of a novel UV/VIS grating spectrometer has been developed based upon a con-centric arrangement of a spherical meniscus lens, concave spherical mirror and curved diffraction grating suitable for a range of atmospheric remote sensing applications from the ground or space. The spectrometer is compact and provides high optical efficiency and performance benefits over tra-ditional instruments. The concentric design is capable of handling high relative apertures, owing to spherical aberra-tion and comma being near zero at all surfaces. The de-sign also provides correction for transverse chromatic aber-ration and distortion, in addition to correcting for the distor-tion called " smile " , the curvature of the slit image formed at each wavelength. These properties render this design ca-pable of superior spectral and spatial performance with size and weight budgets significantly lower than standard config-urations. This form of spectrometer design offers the po-tential for exceptionally compact instrument for differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) applications from LEO, GEO, HAP or ground-based platforms. The bread-board demonstrator has been shown to offer high throughput and a stable Gaussian line shape with a spectral range from 300 to 450 nm at 0.5 nm resolution, suitable for a number of typical DOAS applications.},

@article{Buchwitz2004,
abstract = {First results concerning the retrieval of tropospheric carbon monoxide (CO) from satellite solar backscatter radiance measurements in the near-infrared spectral region (∼2.3 $\mu$m) are presented. The Weighting Function Modified (WFM) DOAS retrieval algorithm has been used to retrieve vertical columns of CO from SCIA-MACHY/ENVISAT nadir spectra. We present detailed results for three days from the time periode January to October 2003 selected to have good overlap with the daytime CO measurements of MOPITT onboard EOS Terra. Because the WFM-DOAS Version 0.4 CO columns presented in this paper are scaled by a constant factor of 0.5 to compensate for an obvious overestimation we focus on the variability of the retrieved columns rather than on their absolute values. It is shown that plumes of CO resulting from, e.g. biomass burning in Africa, are detectable with single overpass SCIA-MACHY data. Globally, the SCIAMACHY CO columns are in reasonable agreement with the Version 3 CO column data product of MOPITT. For example, for measurements over land, where the quality of the data is typically better than over ocean due to higher surface reflectivity, the standard deviation of the difference with respect to MOPITT is in the range 0.4-0.6×1018 molecules/cm2 and the linear correlation coefficient is between 0.4 and 0.7. The level of agreement between the data of both sensors depends on time and location but is typically within 30{\%} for most latitudes. In the southern hemisphere outside Antarctica SCIAMACHY tends to give systematically higher values than MOPITT. More studies are needed to find out what the reasons for the observed differences with respect to MOPITT are and how the algorithm can be modified to improve the quality of the CO columns as retrieved from SCIAMACHY. {\textcopyright} European Geosciences Union 2004.},

Here, we explored the potential of a commercial infrared laser unit (GasFinder 2.0 from Boreal Laser Ltd) for measurement of volcanic CO2 mixing ratios, and ultimately for estimating the volcanic CO2 flux. Our field tests were conducted at Campi Flegrei near Pozzuoli, Southern Italy, where the GasFinder was used during three campaigns in October 2012, January 2013 and May 2013 to repeatedly measure the path-integrated mixing ratios of CO2 along cross sections of the atmospheric plumes of two major fumarolic fields (Solfatara and Pisciarelli). By using a tomographic post-processing routine, we resolved, for each of the two fields, the contour maps of CO2 mixing ratios in the atmosphere, from the integration of which (and after multiplication by the plumes' transport speeds) the CO2 fluxes were finally obtained. We evaluate a total CO2 output from the Campi Flegrei fumaroles of similar to 490 Mg/day, in line with independent estimates based on in situ (Multi-GAS) observations. We conclude that TDL technique may enable CO2 flux quantification at other volcanoes worldwide.},

It affects almost one in 200 pregnancies and is the single major cause of perinatal death. Stillbirth is associated with a wide range of maternal demographic characteristics, but most of the variations in stillbirth risk are independent of these characteristics. Stillbirth is the end point of multiple processes, but the single most common cause is probably placental dysfunction. Stillbirth is associated with a wide range of biochemical and ultrasonic predictors, but there is limited evidence to support population-based screening. However, the evidence based is weak due to the use of poorly characterised screening tests, the failure to couple risk assessment with a clearly effective intervention for those who screen positive and inadequate study sample sizes. Basic research needs to identify better predictors, and clinical trials need to adopt more rigorous methodologies.},

abstract = {Stillbirth, often defined as death of a fetus ≥20 weeks of gestation, is emotionally devastating for families and caregivers. It is often associated with fetal growth restriction (FGR). Indeed, FGR or small-for-gestational age fetus (SGA) is a major risk factor for stillbirth. In rare cases, this is due to genetic abnormalities or infections. However, in most cases, it is linked to placental insufficiency. This may be due to abnormal placental development or placental damage, thereby resulting in decreased blood flow, oxygen, and nutrients to the fetus. Several placental histological abnormalities are associated with stillbirth, FGR, or both. Most involve vascular abnormalities but some are inflammatory lesions. This paper reviews evidence regarding the relationships between placental function and pathology, FGR, and stillbirth. Issues with clinical relevance, knowledge gaps, and areas for further research are highlighted.},

abstract = {Modelling the risk of abnormal pregnancy-related outcomes such as stillbirth and preterm birth have been proposed in the past. Commonly they utilize maternal demographic and medical history information as predictors, and they are based on conventional statistical modelling techniques. In this study, we utilize state-of-the-art machine learning methods in the task of predicting early stillbirth, late stillbirth and preterm birth pregnancies. The aim of this experimentation is to discover novel risk models that could be utilized in a clinical setting. A CDC data set of almost sixteen million observations was used conduct feature selection, parameter optimization and verification of proposed models. An additional NYC data set was used for external validation. Algorithms such as logistic regression, artificial neural network and gradient boosting decision tree were used to construct individual classifiers. Ensemble learning strategies of these classifiers were also experimented with. The best performing machine learning models achieved 0.76 AUC for early stillbirth, 0.63 for late stillbirth and 0.64 for preterm birth while using a external NYC test data. The repeatable performance of our models demonstrates robustness that is required in this context. Our proposed novel models provide a solid foundation for risk prediction and could be further improved with the addition of biochemical and/or biophysical markers.},

A set of NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and O{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} slant column densities at different elevation angles can be obtained with the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) technique used in the multiple axis configuration.

The retrieval of information on the vertical profile of a trace gas obtained from slant column density DOAS measurements requires: (1) the simulation of the radiative transfer in the atmosphere for Air Mass Factor (AMF) calculation concerning the target trace gases; (2) the application of inversion schemes to derive the vertical profile of the gas pollutants under interest using the AMF matrix as the kernel of the inversion algorithm.

abstract = {New burned area datasets and top-down constraints from atmospheric concentration measurements of pyrogenic gases have decreased the large uncertainty in fire emissions estimates. However, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the contribution of deforestation, savanna, forest, agricultural waste, and peat fires to total global fire emissions. Here we used a revised version of the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford-Approach (CASA) biogeochemical model and improved satellite-derived estimates of area burned, fire activity, and plant productivity to calculate fire emissions for the 19972009 period on a 0.5 spatial resolution with a monthly time step. For November 2000 onwards, estimates were based on burned area, active fire detections, and plant productivity from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. For the partitioning we focused on the MODIS era. We used maps of burned area derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) and Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) active fire data prior to MODIS (19972000) and estimates of plant productivity derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) observations during the same period. Average global fire carbon emissions according to this version 3 of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED3) were 2.0 Pg C year1 with significant interannual variability during 19972001 (2.8 Pg C year1 in 1998 and 1.6 Pg C year1 in 2001). Globally, emissions during 20022007 were relatively constant (around 2.1 Pg C year1) before declining in 2008 (1.7 Pg C year1) and 2009 (1.5 Pg C year1) partly due to lower deforestation fire emissions in South America and tropical Asia. On a regional basis, emissions were highly variable during 20022007 (e.g., boreal Asia, South America, and Indonesia), but these regional differences canceled out at a global level. During the MODIS era (20012009), most carbon emissions were from fires in grasslands and savannas (44{\%}) with smaller contributions from tropical deforestation and degradation fires (20{\%}), woodland fires (mostly confined to the tropics, 16{\%}), forest fires (mostly in the extratropics, 15{\%}), agricultural waste burning (3{\%}), and tropical peat fires (3{\%}). The contribution from agricultural waste fires was likely a lower bound because our approach for measuring burned area could not detect all of these relatively small fires. Total carbon emissions were on average 13{\%} lower than in our previous (GFED2) work. For reduced trace gases such as CO and CH4, deforestation, degradation, and peat fires were more important contributors because of higher emissions of reduced trace gases per unit carbon combusted compared to savanna fires. Carbon emissions from tropical deforestation, degradation, and peatland fires were on average 0.5 Pg C year1. The carbon emissions from these fires may not be balanced by regrowth following fire. Our results provide the first global assessment of the contribution of different sources to total global fire emissions for the past decade, and supply the community with an improved 13-year fire emissions time series.},

Measurements are made twice a day, at sunrise and sunset, by looking at the sunlight scattered at zenith in the visible range. NO2 and O-3 vertical abundances are deduced by the differential absorption method. The error sources of the method are discussed in detail. For most observation conditions, the precision of measurement is estimated at about 11{\%} for NO2 and 6{\%} for O-3. However larger errors might be encountered occasionally due to tropospheric pollution or enhanced multiple scattering in thick clouds. It is shown that the signature of such events can be detected in the evolution of the retrieved vertical column during the twilight period. A systematic method to detect and reject data significantly biased is described and applied to the NO2 time-series of measurements.},

abstract = {Objective: To quantify how the changing stillbirth risk profile of women is affecting the interpretation of the stillbirth rate. Design: A retrospective, population-based cohort study from 1983 to 2018. Setting: Victoria, Australia. Population: A total of 2 419 923 births at ≥28 weeks of gestation. Methods: Changes in maternal characteristics over time were assessed. A multivariable logistic regression model was developed for stillbirth, based on maternal characteristics in 1983–1987, and used to calculate individual predictive probabilities of stillbirth from the regression equation. The number of expected stillbirths per year as a result of the change in maternal demographics was then calculated, assuming no changes in care and in the associations between maternal characteristics and stillbirth over time. Main outcome measure: Stillbirth. Results: Compared with 1983–1987, there were more women in older age groups giving birth, more nulliparous women, more indigenous women and women born in Oceania, Asia and Africa, more multiple pregnancies and more women with pre-existing diabetes in 2014–2018. Despite this, the rate of stillbirth fell from 5.42 per 1000 births in 1983 to 1.72 per 1000 births in 2018 (P {\textless} 0.001). Applying the multivariable logistic regression equation, derived from the 1983–87 data, to each year, had there been no changes in care or in the associations between maternal characteristics and stillbirth, the rate of stillbirth would have increased by 12{\%}, from 4.94 per 1000 in 1983 to 5.54 per 1000 in 2018, as a result of the change in maternal characteristics. Conclusions: Population rates of stillbirth are falling faster than is generally appreciated. Tweetable abstract: Population reductions in stillbirth have been underestimated as a result of changing maternal characteristics.},

The Smoke originated from a fire has a chemical composition different from that of a normal atmosphere. This chemical composition is determined by the analysis of light absorption, which passes through the Smoke, in its different wavelengths, carried out by a spectrometer. In this case, the spectrometer is associated to a telescope and Solar light is used as the light Source allowing the detection of Smoke originated from a fire in a specific area of the horizon. The maximum distance from which the Smoke can be detected depends only on the potency of the telescope and may be of many kilometers. The installation of the system on a rotating Support and the use of computational logarithms makes the detection in any point of the horizon possible, a completely autonomous way.},

With an ORS-CT system, two-dimensional maps of chemical concentrations can be created that have good spatial and temporal resolution. The mathematical algorithm used to compute the distribution is critical for accurate and useable reconstructions of the concentrations. In this research, a novel reconstruction method was tested that uses maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) combined with two techniques called grid-translation and multi-grid (GT-MG). To evaluate this method, computer simulations were performed using 120 test maps of varying complexity and a simulated ORS system with four instruments and a total of 40 path-integrated measurements. The results were quantitatively compared with two previously used reconstruction methods (single-grid and grid-translation). Results using the GT-MG method were dramatically improved over previously used methods. Quantitatively, peak exposure errors were reduced by up to 85{\%} and artifacts were dramatically minimized.},

The experiment was conducted over an area of 10 m {\^{A}} 15 m using one and two cylindrical polycarbonate containers of diameter 2 m, respectively, filled with NO 2 . The setup was realized with three of the multibeam instruments recently developed by Pundt and Mettendorf (Appl. Opt., 2005, in press), 1 which allow the simultaneous measurement along at least four light paths each. The configuration consisted of twelve simultaneous light beams, 39 horizontal light paths in total, and 18 different cylinder positions inside the field. It was found that for the discretization and inversion technique shown here reconstructions of the concentration distributions from experimental data agree well with simulated reconstructions. In order to draw conclusions for atmospheric applications, numerical studies including instrumental errors were carried out. It was found that with the presented measurement setup it is possible to measure and reconstruct one or two NO 2 plumes of 600 m diameter and average concentrations above 4.2 ppbv each, on a scale of 13.5 km 2 . Theoretical investigations show that it should be possible to localize and quantify 600 m diameter plumes of SO 2 4 1.5 ppbv, H 2 CO 4 6.3 ppbv, HONO 4 3.2 ppbv, and ozone 4 46.2 ppbv.

abstract = {Background: Air pollution is becoming an increased burden to the world. Previous studies have confirmed its effects on adverse birth outcomes, but few associated with premature small for gestational age (SGA). We report a retrospective cohort study conducted in Changzhou city to evaluate the association between air pollutants (PM2.5, SO2 and NO2) and premature SGA during pregnancy. Methods: A total of 46,224 births were collected from January, 2013 to December, 2016, in Changzhou Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital, finally 2709 preterm births were admitted for study. Corresponding air monitoring data were collected from Changzhou Environmental Protection Agency. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association between these air pollutants and premature SGA controlling for individual covariates in single- and multi-pollutant models. Results: We found that, in the third trimester, every 10 $\mu$g/m3 increments in PM2.5 concentration were associated with premature SGA (OR = 1.18, 95{\%} CI: 1.03-2.83; OR = 1.37, 95{\%} CI: 1.03-3.58) in two- and three-pollutants models. In the whole gestation, a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increment in PM2.5 concentration in two- and three-pollutant models were related to premature SGA (OR = 1.53, 95{\%} CI: 1.38-2.47; OR = 1.73, 95{\%} CI: 1.18-2.57). The OR (95{\%} CI) of premature SGA were increasing across quintiles of PM2.5, SO2, NO2 concentrations during the whole gestation period adjusting for confounders (P for trend {\textless} 0.001). Conclusions: These results indicated that pregnant women exposed to PM2.5, combined with other pollutants in the third trimester have a higher risk to deliver premature SGA babies, providing further evidence linking PM2.5 and pregnancy outcomes.},

The paper is not intended to provide a comprehensive overview but rather describes some subareas and directions which from my personal point of view seem to be important for applying machine learning in medical diagnosis. In the historical overview, I emphasize the naive Bayesian classifier, neural networks and decision trees. I present a comparison of some state-of-the-art systems, representatives from each branch of machine learning, when applied to several medical diagnostic tasks. The future trends are illustrated by two case studies. The first describes a recently developed method for dealing with reliability of decisions of classifiers, which seems to be promising for intelligent data analysis in medicine. The second describes an approach to using machine learning in order to verify some unexplained phenomena from complementary medicine, which is not (yet) approved by the orthodox medical community but could in the future play an important role in overall medical diagnosis and treatment.

abstract = {Deep learning has revolutionized many machine learning tasks in recent years, ranging from image classification and video processing to speech recognition and natural language understanding. The data in these tasks are typically represented in the Euclidean space. However, there is an increasing number of applications where data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and are represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependency between objects. The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in data mining and machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the state-of-the-art graph neural networks into different categories. With a focus on graph convolutional networks, we review alternative architectures that have recently been developed; these learning paradigms include graph attention networks, graph autoencoders, graph generative networks, and graph spatial-temporal networks. We further discuss the applications of graph neural networks across various domains and summarize the open source codes and benchmarks of the existing algorithms on different learning tasks. Finally, we propose potential research directions in this fast-growing field.},

abstract = {Carbon monoxide (CO) is an important atmospheric constituent affecting air quality, and methane (CH4) is the second most important greenhouse gas contributing to human-induced climate change. Detailed and continuous observations of these gases are necessary to better assess their impact on climate and atmospheric pollution. While surface and airborne measurements are able to accurately determine atmospheric abundances on local scales, global coverage can only be achieved using satellite instruments. The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite, which was successfully launched in October 2017, is a spaceborne nadirviewing imaging spectrometer measuring solar radiation reflected by the Earth in a push-broom configuration. It has a wide swath on the terrestrial surface and covers wavelength bands between the ultraviolet (UV) and the shortwave infrared (SWIR), combining a high spatial resolution with daily global coverage. These characteristics enable the determination of both gases with an unprecedented level of detail on a global scale, introducing new areas of application. Abundances of the atmospheric column-averaged dry air mole fractions XCO and XCH4 are simultaneously retrieved from TROPOMI's radiance measurements in the 2:3 $\mu$m spectral range of the SWIR part of the solar spectrum using the scientific retrieval algorithm Weighting Function Modified Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (WFMDOAS). This algorithm is intended to be used with the operational algorithms for mutual verification and to provide new geophysical insights. We introduce the algorithm in detail, including expected error characteristics based on synthetic data, a machine-learning-based quality filter, and a shallow learning calibration procedure applied in the post-processing of the XCH4 data. The quality of the results based on real TROPOMI data is assessed by validation with ground-based Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) measurements providing realistic error estimates of the satellite data: the XCO data set is characterised by a random error of 5:1 ppb (5:8 {\%}) and a systematic error of 1:9 ppb (2:1 {\%}); the XCH4 data set exhibits a random error of 14:0 ppb (0:8 {\%}) and a systematic error of 4:3 ppb (0:2 {\%}). The natural XCO and XCH4 variations are well-captured by the satellite retrievals, which is demonstrated by a high correlation with the validation data (R = 0:97 for XCO and R = 0:91 for XCH4 based on daily averages). We also present selected results from the mission start until the end of 2018, including a first comparison to the operational products and examples of the detection of emission sources in a single satellite overpass, such as CO emissions from the steel industry and CH4 emissions from the energy sector, which potentially allows for the advance of emission monitoring and air quality assessments to an entirely new level.},

The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout” that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3{\%}, compared to 26.2{\%} achieved by the second-best entry.},

These phantoms cannot sufficiently cover the broad spectrum of applications in CT imaging where, for instance, smooth or piecewise-smooth 3D objects are common. TomoPhantom provides quick access to an external library of modular analytical 2D/3D phantoms with temporal extensions. In TomoPhantom, quite complex phantoms can be built using additive combinations of geometrical objects, such as, Gaussians, parabolas, cones, ellipses, rectangles and volumetric extensions of them. Newly designed phantoms are better suited for benchmarking and testing of different image processing techniques. Specifically, tomographic reconstruction algorithms which employ 2D and 3D scanning geometries, can be rigorously analyzed using the software. TomoPhantom also provides a capability of obtaining analytical tomographic projections which further extends the applicability of software towards more realistic, free from the “inverse crime” testing. All core modules of the package are written in the C-OpenMP language and wrappers for Python and MATLAB are provided to enable easy access. Due to C-based multi-threaded implementation, volumetric phantoms of high spatial resolution can be obtained with computational efficiency.},

The pro-cedure consists of pointing the receiving telescope of the spectrometer to nonreflecting surfaces or to bright targets placed at known distances from the measuring device, which are illuminated by sunlight. We show that the partial trace gas absorptions between the top of the atmosphere and the target can be easily removed from the measured total absorption. Thus it is possible to derive the average concentration of trace gases such as NO 2 , HCHO, SO 2 , H 2 O, Glyoxal, BrO, and others along the line of sight between the instrument and the target similar to the well-known long-path DOAS observations (but with much less expense). If tomographic arrangements are used, even two-or three-dimensional trace gas distri-butions can be retrieved. The basic assumptions of the proposed method are confirmed by test measure-ments taken across the city of Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Accurate and consistent classification of causes and associated conditions for perinatal deaths is essential to inform strategies to reduce the five million which occur globally each year. With the majority of deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), their needs must be prioritised. The aim of this paper is to review the classification of perinatal death, the contemporary classification systems including the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases – Perinatal Mortality (ICD-PM), and next steps. During the period from 2009 to 2014, a total of 81 new or modified classification systems were identified with the majority developed in high-income countries (HICs). Structure, definitions and rules and therefore data on causes vary widely and implementation is suboptimal. Whereas system testing is limited, none appears ideal. Several systems result in a high proportion of unexplained stillbirths, prompting HICs to use more detailed systems that require data unavailable in low-income countries. Some systems appear to perform well across these different settings. ICD-PM addresses some shortcomings of ICD-10 for perinatal deaths, but important limitations remain, especially for stillbirths. A global approach to classification is needed and seems feasible. The new ICD-PM system is an important step forward and improvements will be enhanced by wide-scale use and evaluation.

abstract = {Millions of children in polluted cities are showing brain detrimental effects. Urban children exhibit brain structural and volumetric abnormalities, systemic inflammation, olfactory, auditory, vestibular and cognitive deficits v low-pollution controls. Neuroinflammation and blood-brain-barrier (BBB) breakdown target the olfactory bulb, prefrontal cortex and brainstem, but are diffusely present throughout the brain. Urban adolescent Apolipoprotein E4 carriers significantly accelerate Alzheimer pathology. Neurocognitive effects of air pollution are substantial, apparent across all populations, and potentially clinically relevant as early evidence of evolving neurodegenerative changes. The diffuse nature of the neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration forces to employ a weight of evidence approach incorporating current clinical, cognitive, neurophysiological, radiological and epidemiological research. Pediatric air pollution research requires extensive multidisciplinary collaborations to accomplish a critical goal: to protect exposed children through multidimensional interventions having both broad impact and reach. Protecting children and teens from neural effects of air pollution should be of pressing importance for public health. {\textcopyright} 2014 Calder{\'{o}}n-Garcidue{\~{n}}as, Torres-Jard{\'{o}}n, Kulesza, Park and D'Angiulli.},

abstract = {In this study, we theoretically investigate the re-construction of 2-D cross sections through Gaussian concen-tration distributions, e.g. emission plumes, from long path DOAS measurements along a limited number of light paths. This is done systematically with respect to the extension of the up to four peaks and for six different measurement setups with 2–4 telescopes and 36 light paths each. We distinguish between cases with and without additional background con-centrations. Our approach parametrises the unknown distri-bution by local piecewise constant or linear functions on a regular grid and solves the resulting discrete, linear system by a least squares minimum norm principle. We show that the linear parametrisation not only allows better representa-tion of the distributions in terms of discretisation errors, but also better inversion of the system. We calculate area inte-grals of the concentration field (i.e. total emissions rates for non-vanishing perpendicular wind speed components) and show that reconstruction errors and reconstructed area inte-grals within the peaks for narrow distributions crucially de-pend on the resolution of the reconstruction grid. A recently suggested grid translation method for the piecewise con-stant basis functions, combining reconstructions from sev-eral shifted grids, is modified for the linear basis functions and proven to reduce overall reconstruction errors, but not the uncertainty of concentration integrals. We suggest a pro-cedure to subtract additional background concentration fields before inversion. We find large differences in reconstruction quality between the geometries and conclude that, in general, for a constant number of light paths increasing the number of telescopes leads to better reconstruction results. It ap-pears that geometries that give better results for negligible measurement errors and parts of the geometry that are better resolved are also less sensitive to increasing measurement er-rors.},

For over a decade, LAS measurements from multiple sources and tens of retroreflectors have been combined with sparse-sample tomography methods to estimate the 2-D distribution of trace gas concentrations and underlying fluxes from point-like sources. In this work, we consider the ability of such a system to detect and estimate the position and rate of a single point leak which may arise as a failure mode for carbon dioxide storage. The leak is assumed to be at a constant rate giving rise to a plume with a concentration and distribution that depend on the wind velocity. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to detect a leak using numerical simulation and also present a preliminary measurement.},

This novel technique serves to measure 2-3-dimensional concentration fields of different trace gases (e.g. NO 2, SO 2, ozone) in the planetary boundary layer on a small scale (100-10 000 m) by the use of multiple light paths. Ways to use telescopes, lamps, retroreflector arrays and spectrometers for the simultaneous measurement of many light-paths are proposed.

abstract = {Multi Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spec- troscopy (MAX-DOAS) in the atmosphere is a novel mea- surement technique that represents a significant advance on the well-established zenith scattered sunlight DOAS instru- ments which are mainly sensitive to stratospheric absorbers. MAX-DOAS utilizes scattered sunlight received from mul- tiple viewing directions. The spatial distribution of various trace gases close to the instrument can be derived by combin- ing several viewing directions. Ground based MAX-DOAS is highly sensitive to absorbers in the lowest few kilome- tres of the atmosphere and vertical profile information can be retrieved by combining the measurements with Radia- tive Transfer Model (RTM) calculations. The potential of the technique for a wide variety of studies of tropospheric trace species and its (few) limitations are discussed. AMonte Carlo RTM is applied to calculate Airmass Factors (AMF) for the various viewing geometries ofMAX-DOAS. Airmass Factors can be used to quantify the light path length within the absorber layers. The airmass factor dependencies on the viewing direction and the influence of several parameters (trace gas profile, ground albedo, aerosol profile and type, solar zenith and azimuth angles) are investigated. In addition we give a brief description of the instrumental MAX-DOAS systems realised and deployed so far. The results of the RTM studies are compared to several examples of recent MAX- DOAS field experiments and an outlook for future possible applications is given.},

abstract = {Background: The Lombardy region in northern Italy ranks among the most air polluted areas of Europe. Previous studies showed air pollution short-term effects on all-cause mortality. We examine here the effects of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10 $\mu$m (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure on deaths and hospitalizations from specific causes, including cardiac, cerebrovascular and respiratory diseases. Methods: We considered air pollution, mortality and hospitalization data for a non-opportunistic sample of 18 highly polluted and most densely populated areas of the region in the years 2003-2006. We obtained area-specific effect estimates for PM10 and NO2 from a Poisson regression model on the daily number of total deaths or cause-specific hospitalizations and then combined them in a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis. For cause-specific mortality, we applied a case-crossover analysis. Age- and season-specific analyses were also performed. Effect estimates were expressed as percent variation in mortality or hospitalizations associated with a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM10 or NO2 concentration. Results: Natural mortality was positively associated with both pollutants (0.30{\%}, 90{\%} Credibility Interval [CrI]: -0.31; 0.78 for PM10; 0.70{\%}, 90{\%}CrI: 0.10; 1.27 for NO2). Cardiovascular deaths showed a higher percent variation in association with NO2 (1.12{\%}, 90{\%} Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.14; 2.11), while the percent variation for respiratory mortality was highest in association with PM10 (1.64{\%}, 90{\%}CI: 0.35; 2.93). The effect of both pollutants was more evident in the summer season. Air pollution was also associated to hospitalizations, the highest variations being 0.77{\%} (90{\%}CrI: 0.22; 1.43) for PM10 and respiratory diseases, and 1.70{\%} (90{\%}CrI: 0.39; 2.84) for NO2 and cerebrovascular diseases. The effect of PM10 on respiratory hospital admissions appeared to increase with age. For both pollutants, effects on cerebrovascular hospitalizations were more evident in subjects aged less than 75 years. Conclusions: Our study provided a sound characterization of air pollution exposure and its potential effects on human health in the most polluted, and also most populated and productive, Italian region, further documenting the need for effective public health policies.},

In some domains, like bioinformatics and robotics, it is very difficult to construct a large-scale well-annotated dataset due to the expense of data acquisition and costly annotation, which limits its development. Transfer learning relaxes the hypothesis that the training data must be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with the test data, which motivates us to use transfer learning to solve the problem of insufficient training data. This survey focuses on reviewing the current researches of transfer learning by using deep neural network and its applications.

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associa- tive memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive ver- sion of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribu- tion of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning al- gorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind.},

The first approach performs the inversion by solving a regularized least squares problem. Regularization is required because the retrieval of the distribution from a limited set of measurements is an ill-posed problem. This approach does not consider the nonnegativity of the trace gas concentrations. The second approach is a new proposal that solves an optimization problem with the Laplacian of the solution as the regularization term. This approach enables the possibility of adding the nonnegativity constraint to the solution. The algorithm here is stated as an instance of a convex optimization problem and can numerically be solved using, for example, the CVX package. We test both approaches on reconstructions of simulated gas distributions and different experimental configurations applicable to Multi-Axis DOAS and multispectral imaging measurements. From the results, we can then determine a set of reconstruction parameters appropriate to real plume measurements.},

It has a number of different emission sources, but motor vehicles and industrial processes contribute the major part of air pollution. According to the World Health Organization, six major air pollutants include particle pollution, ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead. Long and short term exposure to air suspended toxicants has a different toxicological impact on human including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, neuropsychiatric complications, the eyes irritation, skin diseases, and long-term chronic diseases such as cancer. Several reports have revealed the direct association between exposure to the poor air quality and increasing rate of morbidity and mortality mostly due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Air pollution is considered as the major environmental risk factor in the incidence and progression of some diseases such as asthma, lung cancer, ventricular hypertrophy, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, psychological complications, autism, retinopathy, fetal growth, and low birth weight. In this review article, we aimed to discuss toxicology of major air pollutants, sources of emission, and their impact on human health.

abstract = {Forest fires are an important component of the savanna, tundra and boreal forest ecosystems. The increasing rate of the occurrence of fires however has increased the concern over their impacts on climate change and fragile ecosystems. This requires efficient and effective methods in forest fire detection for near real-time monitoring so as to minimize these impacts. Remote sensing has been widely used in active forest fire detection; however there are some limitations in contextual algorithms which are used in forest fire detection. These contextual algorithms are greatly affected by clouds and different land cover types such as land and water with inherent temperatures included in the N x N matrix and this brings errors. As a step towards minimizing these problems an automated multi-temporal threshold algorithm was developed in this study using MSG satellite and ground fire data from Portugal. The algorithm is based on temperature anomalies detected in IR3.9 channel and the difference between IR3.9 and IR10.8 channels as well as the solar zenith angles for day, night and twilight conditions. Thresholds were set to determine actual fires and possible fires depending on how far the temperature of a particular point or pixel deviates from the normal background temperature which is estimated using the images directly prior to the actual image. The accuracy of the algorithm was compared with that of the MSG FIR-G product. The McNemar's test was used for significance test of the difference between the multi-temporal threshold algorithm and the MSG FIR-G product which uses a contextual algorithm. This study shows that the multi-temporal threshold algorithm has higher fire detection rate (50{\%}) as compared to MSG FIR-G (3.7{\%}) when ground data from Portugal was used for validation. There is a significant difference between these methods (McNemar's test ( x2) = 5.45, df = 1, p-value = 0.0196). The superiority of the multitemporal threshold algorithm over the contextual algorithm and significant difference between these methods was also confirmed in Southern Africa when MODIS fire product was used for validation. The automated procedure takes less than 15 minutes to produce the fire map, so it can cope with MSG satellite 15 minutes temporal resolution. Therefore the multi-temporal threshold algorithm performs better than the contextual algorithms in forest fire detection however there are some outstanding problems such as the transparent clouds that are not easily detected which may increase the errors in fire detection. Although this method was developed based on Portugal data it has been shown that it can be applied to other areas in the view of MSG satellite. This method can be easily adapted to other geostationary satellites and only the solar zenith angles have to be specific to the particular satellite.},

abstract = {Stillbirth is delivery of a baby at or after 24 weeks of gestational age (UK definition) not showing any signs of life. It affects almost one in 200 pregnancies and is the single major cause of perinatal death. Stillbirth is associated with a wide range of maternal demographic characteristics, but most of the variations in stillbirth risk are independent of these characteristics. Stillbirth is the end point of multiple processes, but the single most common cause is probably placental dysfunction. Stillbirth is associated with a wide range of biochemical and ultrasonic predictors, but there is limited evidence to support population-based screening. However, the evidence based is weak due to the use of poorly characterised screening tests, the failure to couple risk assessment with a clearly effective intervention for those who screen positive and inadequate study sample sizes. Basic research needs to identify better predictors, and clinical trials need to adopt more rigorous methodologies.},

abstract = {Background: In 2004 the concept of evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) was introduced at the ICSE04 conference. Aims: This study assesses the impact of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) which are the recommended EBSE method for aggregating evidence. Method: We used the standard systematic literature review method employing a manual search of 10 journals and 4 conference proceedings. Results: Of 20 relevant studies, eight addressed research trends rather than technique evaluation. Seven SLRs addressed cost estimation. The quality of SLRs was fair with only three scoring less than 2 out of 4. Conclusions: Currently, the topic areas covered by SLRs are limited. European researchers, particularly those at the Simula Laboratory appear to be the leading exponents of systematic literature reviews. The series of cost estimation SLRs demonstrate the potential value of EBSE for synthesising evidence and making it available to practitioners. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The photolysis of nitrous acid (HONO) in the early morning hours is believed to be a significant source of hydroxyl radicals (OH), the most important daytime oxidizing species. Although the importance of this mechanism has been recognized for many years, no accurate experimental quantification is available. Here we present measurements of HONO, NO2, SO2, O-3 and HCHO by Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) during the Limitation of Oxidant Production/Pianura Padana Produzione di Ozono (LOOP/PIPAPO) study in May-June 1998 in Milan, Italy. The concentration of NO and J(NO2)/J(HONO) were simultaneously monitored by in situ monitors. The photolysis frequencies of HCHO and O-3 were determined with a radiative transfer model. High nocturnal HONO mixing ratios of up to 4.4 ppb were regularly observed. Elevated daytime HONO levels during cloudy periods show that the formation of HONO proceeds after sunrise and therefore also represents a source of hydroxyl radicals throughout the day. Averaged over 24 hours, HCHO photolysis is the most important source of OH in Milan, followed by either ozone or HONO photolysis. Our observations indicate that on certain days the OH production from HONO can be even more important than that from ozone photolysis. The diurnal variation of the different OH formation mechanisms shows that HONO photolysis is by far the most important source in the early hours of the morning, and can be as large as and even surpass the total OH production at noon.},

Selected wavelength regions are rapidly and repetitively swept by a monochromator to sensitively record the atmospheric absorption spectrum while avoiding the detrimental effects of atmospheric turbulence. By computer fitting to stored laboratory spectra, we can evaluate the path-averaged concentration of a number of important pollutants such as NO2, SO2, and 03.

abstract = {We examined the associations between the daily variations of air pollutants and hospital admissions for respiratory diseases in İstanbul, the largest city of Turkey. A time series analysis of counts of daily hospital admissions and outdoor air pollutants was performed using single-pollutant Poisson generalized linear model (GLM) while controlling for time trends and meteorological factors over a 3-year period (2013–2015) at different time lags (0–9 days). Effects of the pollutants (Excess Risk, ER) on current-day (lag 0) hospital admissions to the first ten days (lag 9) were determined. Data on hospital admissions, daily mean concentrations of air pollutants of PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 and daily mean concentrations of temperature and humidity of İstanbul were used in the study. The analysis was conducted among people of all ages, but also focused on different sexes and different age groups including children (0–14 years), adults (35–44 years) and elderly (≥65 years). We found significant associations between air pollution and respiratory related hospital admissions in the city. Our findings showed that the relative magnitude of risks for an association of the pollutants with the total respiratory hospital admissions was in the order of: PM2.5, NO2, and PM10. The highest association of each pollutant with total hospital admission was observed with PM2.5 at lag 4 (ER = 1.50; 95{\%} CI = 1.09–1.99), NO2 at lag 4 (ER = 1.27; 95{\%} CI = 1.02–1.53) and PM10 at lag 0 (ER = 0.61; 95{\%} CI = 0.33–0.89) for an increase of 10 $\mu$g/m3 in concentrations of the pollutants. In conclusion, our study showed that short-term exposure to air pollution was positively associated with increased respiratory hospital admissions in İstanbul during 2013–2015. As the first air pollution hospital admission study using GLM in İstanbul, these findings may have implications for local environmental and social policies.},

abstract = {Aromatic hydrocarbons are well known air toxics which are regulated by the US EPA and other air quality agencies. Accurate, long-term monitoring of these compounds at low part-per-billion levels, as well as identifying emission point sources is therefore crucial to protect human health in neighborhoods near large emission sources. Here we present a new long-path differential optical absorption spectroscopy (LP-DOAS) instrument specifically designed to monitor aromatic hydrocarbons. The system is based on a novel dual - light emitting diode (LED) light source, which eliminates the requirement to suppress spectrometer stray light. This light source, together with a high stability fiber-based sending/receiving telescope, allows the measurement of aromatic hydrocarbons on once-folded absorptions paths of 200–1200 m length. The new instrument shows very good agreement with simultaneous in-situ measurements if inhomogeneities of the trace gas spatial distributions are considered. The new instrument performed well during a three-month field test as an automated fence-line monitor at a refinery, successfully distinguishing upwind background levels of ∼1 ppb from emissions reflected in elevated mixing ratios of 3–4 ppb. A two-dimensional measurement network based on two identical LP-DOAS instruments operating on seven crossed light paths was operated successfully in Houston, TX. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of two events with toluene and xylene plumes demonstrate how this setup can be used to derive the spatial distribution of aromatic hydrocarbons, and identify point sources.},

abstract = {We present a new computed tomography method, the low third derivative (LTD) method, that is particularly suited for reconstructing the spatial distribution of gas concentrations from path-integral data for a small number of optical paths. The method finds a spatial distribution of gas concentrations that (1) has path integrals that agree with measured path integrals, and (2) has a low third spatial derivative in each direction, at every point. The trade-off between (1) and (2) is controlled by an adjustable parameter, which can be set based on analysis of the path-integral data. The method produces a set of linear equations, which can be solved with a single matrix multiplication if the constraint that all concentrations must be positive is ignored; the method is therefore extremely rapid. Analysis of experimental data from thousands of concentration distributions shows that the method works nearly as well as smooth basis function minimization (the best method previously available), yet is about 100 times faster.

On 18–19 February 2015, the CAT scan network detected large nocturnal plumes of toluene and xylenes most likely associated with railcar loading and unloading operations at Ship Channel petrochemical facilities. The presence of such plumes during railcar operations was confirmed by a mobile laboratory equipped with a Proton Transfer Reaction—Mass Spectrometer (PTR-MS), which measured transient peaks of toluene and C2-benzenes of 50 ppb and 57 ppb respectively around 4 a.m. LST on 19 February 2015. Plume reconstruction and source attribution were performed using the 4D variational data assimilation technique and a 3D micro-scale forward and adjoint air quality model based on both tomographic and PTR-MS data. Inverse model estimates of fugitive emissions associated with railcar transfer emissions ranged from 2.0 to 8.2 kg/hr for toluene and from 2.2 to 3.5 kg/hr for xylenes in the early morning of 19 February 2015.},

abstract = {TomoSim comes as part of project ATMOS, a miniaturised Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) tomographic atmospheric evaluation device, designed to fit a small drone. During the development of the project, it became necessary to write a simulation tool for system validation. TomoSim is the answer to this problem. The software has two main goals: to mathematically validate the tomographic acquisition method; and to allow some adjustments to the system before reaching final product stages. This measurement strategy was based on a drone performing a sequential trajectory and gathering projections arranged in fan beams, before using some classical tomographic methods to reconstruct a spectral image. The team tested three different reconstruction algorithms, all of which were able to produce an image, validating the team's initial assumptions regarding the trajectory and acquisition strategy. All algorithms were assessed on their computational performance and their ability for reconstructing spectral “images”, using two phantoms, one of which custom made for this purpose. In the end, the team was also able to uncover certain limitations of the TomoSim approach that should be addressed before the final stages of the system.},

abstract = {Currently, open path Fourier transform infrared (OP-FTIR) spectrometers have been applied in some fenceline monitoring, but their use has been limited because path-integrated concentration measurements typically only provide an estimate of the average concentration. We present a series of experiments that further explore the use of path-integrated measurements to reconstruct various pollutant distributions along a linear path. Our experiments were conducted in a ventilation chamber using an OP-FTIR instrument to monitor a tracer-gas release over a fenceline configuration. These experiments validate a line profile method (1-D reconstruction). Additionally, we expand current reconstruction techniques by applying the Bootstrap to our measurements. We compared our reconstruction results to our point samplers using the concordance correlation factor (CCF). Of the four different release types, three were successfully reconstructed with CCFs greater than 0.9. The difficult reconstruction involved a narrow release where the pollutant was limited to one segment of the segmented beampath. In general, of the three reconstruction methods employed, the average of the bootstrapped reconstructions was found to have the highest CCFs when compared to the point samplers. Furthermore, the bootstrap method was the most flexible and allowed a determination of the uncertainty surrounding our reconstructions. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper presents a procedure for performing and optimizing inversions for DOAS tomography and its ap-plication to measurement data. DOAS tomography is a new technique to determine 2-and 3-dimensional concentration fields of air pollutants or other trace gases by combining dif-ferential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) with tomo-graphic inversion techniques. Due to the limited amount of measured data, the resulting concentration fields are sensitive to the inversion process. Therefore detailed error estimations are needed to determine the quality of the reconstruction. In this paper we compare different row acting methods for the inversion, present a procedure for optimizing the parameters of the reconstruction process and propose a way to estimate the error-fields by numerical studies. The procedure was ap-plied to data from the motorway emission campaign BAB II. Two dimensional NO 2 cross sections at right angles to the motorway could be reconstructed qualitatively well at differ-ent meteorological situations. Additionally we present error fields for the reconstructions which show the problems and skills of the used measurement setup. Numerical studies on an improved setup for future motorway campaigns show, that DOAS tomography is able to produce high quality concentra-tion maps.},

Ever since the word first appeared in the Middle Ages, anyone who delights in evil and in the destruction of the self or others has been described as 'perverse'. But while the experience of perversion is universal, every era has seen it and dealt with it in its own way. The history of perversion in the West is told here through a study of great emblematic figures of the perverse - Gilles de Rais, the mystical saints and the flagellants in the middle ages, the Marquis de Sade in the eighteenth century, the masturbating child, the male homosexual and the hysterical woman nineteenth century, Nazism in the twentieth century, and the complementary figures of the paedophile and the terrorist in the twenty-first. The perverse are rarely talked about and when they are it is usually only to be condemned. They are commonly viewed as monstrous and cruel, as something alien to the very nature of being human. And yet, perversion can also attest to creativity and self-transcendence, to the refusal of individuals to submit to the rules and prohibitions that govern human life. Perversion fascinates us precisely because it can be both abject and sublime. Whether they are sublime because they turn to art or mysticism, or abject because they surrender to their murderous impulses, the perverse are part of us because they exhibit something that we always conceal: our own negativity and our dark side.},

abstract = {A novel experimental procedure to measure the near-surface distribution of atmospheric trace gases by using passive multiaxis differential absorption optical spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) is proposed. The procedure consists of pointing the receiving telescope of the spectrometer to nonreflecting surfaces or to bright targets placed at known distances from the measuring device, which are illuminated by sunlight. We show that the partial trace gas absorptions between the top of the atmosphere and the target can be easily removed from the measured total absorption. Thus it is possible to derive the average concentration of trace gases such as NO2, HCHO, SO2, H2O, Glyoxal, BrO, and others along the line of sight between the instrument and the target similar to the well-known long-path DOAS observations (but with much less expense). If tomographic arrangements are used, even two- or three-dimensional trace gas distributions can be retrieved. The basic assumptions of the proposed method are confirmed by test measurements taken across the city of Heidelberg. {\textcopyright} 2006 Optical Society of America.},

We evaluate its ability to reason about several challenging physical domains: n-body problems, rigid-body collision, and non-rigid dynamics. Our results show it can be trained to accurately simulate the physical trajectories of dozens of objects over thousands of time steps, estimate abstract quantities such as energy, and generalize automatically to systems with different numbers and configurations of objects and relations.

abstract = {Within this work we present the application of a new, portable open-path measurement system for the simultaneous determination of NO and NO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} in the atmosphere. The system is based on two pulsed distributed feedback mid-IR quantum cascade laser and a fast thermo-electrically cooled mercury-cadmium-telluride detector. Limits of detection (LoD) below 1$\mu$gm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} are achieved for both analytes during one minute measurement time and using an optical path-length of up to 428m. An accuracy below 10 ngm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} and a precision below 0.76$\mu$gm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} could be calculated based on minute mean values for 100m path-length. Reducing the measurement time to one second LoDs of approximately 7$\mu$gm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} are obtained. During the 300ns laser pulses micro-spectra for NO and NO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, each of typically 1.2cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} width and a spectral resolution of 0.02cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, are recorded and evaluated. The chosen rotation-vibrational doublets are located at approximately 1900cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} for NO and 1630cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} for NO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}. The obtained results show good correlation to the reference method based on chemiluminescence. A particular advantage of the new method is that it provides real time information on the existing NO/NO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} ratio in the measured air. This in turn allows distinguishing between the different emission sources and is demonstrated here by data obtained from different vehicles passing close to the measurement path. These events temporally increased the NO and NO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} concentrations at characteristic ratios from the background values.},

METHODS: Twenty-five patients underwent thoraco-abdominal CTA with 128-slice dual-source CT, operating both tubes at 120 kV. Full-dose (FD) images were reconstructed with FBP and were compared to half-dose (HD) images with FBP and HD-images with sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE), both reconstructed using data from only one tube-detector-system. Image quality and sharpness of the aortic contour were assessed. Vessel attenuation and noise were measured, contrast-to-noise-ratio was calculated. RESULTS: Noise as image quality deteriorating artefact occurred in 24/25 (96{\%}) HD-FBP but not in FD-FBP and HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction datasets (p {\textless} 0.001). Other artefacts occurred with similar prevalence among the datasets. Sharpness of the aortic contour was higher for FD-FBP and HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction as compared to HD-FBP (p {\textless} 0.001). Aortoiliac attenuation was similar among all datasets (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Lowest noise was found for HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction (7.23HU), being 9.4{\%} lower than that in FD-FBP (7.98HU, p {\textless} 0.05) and 30.8{\%} lower than in HD-FBP images (10.44HU, p {\textless} 0.001). Contrast-to-noise-ratio was lower in HD-FBP (p {\textless} 0.001) and higher in HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction (p {\textless} 0.001) as compared to FD-FBP. CONCLUSION: Intra-individual comparisons of image quality of body CTA suggest that raw data-based iterative reconstruction allows for dose reduction {\textgreater}50{\%} while maintaining image quality. Key Points • Raw data-based iterative reconstruction reduces image noise and improves image quality as compared to filtered back projection • At a similar radiation dose, raw data-based iterative reconstruction improves the sharpness of vessel contours • In body CTA a dose reduction of {\textgreater}50{\%} might be possible when using raw data-based iterative reconstructions, while image quality can be maintained.},

Recommendations are made for system designs to be used for tomographic differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) measurements. The difficulties in producing multiple simultaneous beams from a single artificial light source are discussed, while the need for further tomographic resolution information is highlighted. An innovative prototype scanning-DOAS system is presented. The system is designed to generate multiple sequential paths, without the need for bulky and expensive mechanical systems. The scanning DOAS system can easily be placed in an industrial production plant or in a street canyon for multiple direction monitoring.

Two optical paths have been installed in the DOAS system (OPSIS AB, Sweden), which is operating since September 2007, and both are controlled with the same main unit, and so only one analyzer system studies the light received. A beam-finding servosystem and automatic gain control permit unattended long-time monitoring. The concentrations and standard deviations of a wide number of pollutants, along with light levels in the system are stored in the central unit computer. Being able to monitor a range of user-specified compounds continuously in real time with a single system, the OPSIS instruments offer high levels of accuracy, reliability and data capture. The first results obtained with the DOAS system are presented in this work; comparisons between pollutant data obtained along the two optical paths (and relations between different pollutant concentrations) have been carried out.},

CPSs have the ability to transform the way human-to-human, human-to-object, and object-to-object interactions take place in the physical and virtual worlds. The increasing pervasiveness of wireless sensor networking (WSN) technologies in many applications makes them an important component of emerging CPS designs. We present some of the most important design requirements of CPS architectures. We discuss key sensor network characteristics that can be leveraged in CPS designs. In addition, we also review a few well-known CPS application domains that depend on WSNs in their design architectures and implementations.

Data from the network will be used primarily for volcanic risk assessment but also for geophysical research, studies of atmospheric change, and ground validation of satellite instruments. A novel type of instrument, the scanning miniaturized differential optical absorption spectroscopy (Mini-{\{}DOAS){\}} instrument, is applied in the network to measure volcanic gas emissions by {\{}UV{\}} absorption spectroscopy. The instrument is set up 5–10 km downwind of the volcano under study, and typically two to four instruments are deployed at each volcano in order to cover different wind directions and to facilitate measurements of plume height and plume direction. Two different versions of the instrument have been developed. Version I was designed to be a robust and simple instrument for measurement of volcanic {\{}SO2{\}} emissions at high time resolution with minimal power consumption. Version {\{}II{\}} was designed to allow the best possible spectroscopy and enhanced flexibility in regard to measurement geometry at the cost of larger complexity, power consumption, and price. In this paper the project is described, as well as the developed software, the hardware of the two instrument versions, measurement strategies, data communication, and archiving routines. As of April 2009 a total of 46 instruments have been installed at 18 volcanoes worldwide. As a typical example, the installation at Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador is described, together with some results from the first 21 months of operation at this volcano.},

The analysis of results focuses on frequencies of publications for categories within the scheme. Thereby, the coverage of the research field can be determined. Different facets of the scheme can also be combined to answer more specific research questions. OBJECTIVE: We describe how to conduct a systematic mapping study in software engineering and provide guidelines. We also compare systematic maps and systematic reviews to clarify how to chose between them. This comparison leads to a set of guidelines for systematic maps. METHOD: We have defined a systematic mapping process and applied it to complete a systematic mapping study. Furthermore, we compare systematic maps with systematic reviews by systematically analyzing existing systematic reviews. RESULTS: We describe a process for software engineering systematic mapping studies and compare it to systematic reviews. Based on this, guidelines for conducting systematic maps are defined. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic maps and reviews are different in terms of goals, breadth, validity issues and implications. Thus, they should be used complementarily and require different methods (e.g., for analysis).},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Solfatara is part of the active volcanic zone of Campi Flegrei (Italy), a densely populated urban area where ground uplift and increasing ground temperature are observed, connected with rising rates of CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} emission. A major pathway of CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} release at Campi Flegrei is diffuse soil degassing, and therefore quantifying diffuse CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} emission rates is of vital interest. Conventional in situ probing of soil gas emissions with accumulation chambers is accurate over a small footprint but requires significant time and effort to cover large areas. An alternative approach is differential absorption lidar, which allows for a fast and spatially integrated measurement. Here, a portable hard-target differential absorption lidar has been used to acquire horizontal 1-D profiles of column-integrated CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} concentration at the Solfatara crater. To capture heterogenic features in the CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} distribution, a 2-D tomographic map of the CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} distribution has been inverted from the 1-D profiles. The scan was performed one-sided, which is unfavorable for the inverse problem. Nonetheless, the result is in agreement with independent measurements and furthermore confirms an area of anomalous CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} degassing along the eastern edge as well as the center of the Solfatara crater. The method may have important implications for measurements of degassing features that can only be accessed from limited angles, such as airborne sensing of volcanic plumes. CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} fluxes retrieved from the 2-D map are comparable, but modestly higher than emission rates from previous studies, perhaps reflecting an increase in CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} flux or a more integrated measurement or both.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The experiment was conducted over an area of 10 m {\^{A}} 15 m using one and two cylindrical polycarbonate containers of diameter 2 m, respectively, filled with NO 2 . The setup was realized with three of the multibeam instruments recently developed by Pundt and Mettendorf (Appl. Opt., 2005, in press), 1 which allow the simultaneous measurement along at least four light paths each. The configuration consisted of twelve simultaneous light beams, 39 horizontal light paths in total, and 18 different cylinder positions inside the field. It was found that for the discretization and inversion technique shown here reconstructions of the concentration distributions from experimental data agree well with simulated reconstructions. In order to draw conclusions for atmospheric applications, numerical studies including instrumental errors were carried out. It was found that with the presented measurement setup it is possible to measure and reconstruct one or two NO 2 plumes of 600 m diameter and average concentrations above 4.2 ppbv each, on a scale of 13.5 km 2 . Theoretical investigations show that it should be possible to localize and quantify 600 m diameter plumes of SO 2 4 1.5 ppbv, H 2 CO 4 6.3 ppbv, HONO 4 3.2 ppbv, and ozone 4 46.2 ppbv.

abstract = {Lots of learning tasks require dealing with graph data which contains rich relation information among elements. Modeling physics system, learning molecular fingerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases require that a model learns from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures, like the dependency tree of sentences and the scene graph of images, is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are connectionist models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. Unlike standard neural networks, graph neural networks retain a state that can represent information from its neighborhood with arbitrary depth. Although the primitive GNNs have been found difficult to train for a fixed point, recent advances in network architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled successful learning with them. In recent years, systems based on graph convolutional network (GCN) and gated graph neural network (GGNN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performance on many tasks mentioned above. In this survey, we provide a detailed review over existing graph neural network models, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.},

abstract = {Classification is one of the most popular topics in hyperspectral remote sensing. In the last two decades, a huge number of methods were proposed to deal with the hyperspectral data classification problem. However, most of them do not hierar- chically extract deep features. In this paper, the concept of deep learning is introduced into hyperspectral data classification for the first time. First, we verify the eligibility of stacked autoencoders by following classical spectral information-based classification. Second, a new way of classifying with spatial-dominated informa- tion is proposed. We then propose a novel deep learning framework to merge the two features, from which we can get the highest classification accuracy. The framework is a hybrid of principle component analysis (PCA), deep learning architecture, and logistic regression. Specifically, as a deep learning architecture, stacked autoencoders are aimed to get useful high-level features. Experi- mental results with widely-used hyperspectral data indicate that classifiers built in this deep learning-based framework provide competitive performance. In addition, the proposed joint spectral–spatial deep neural network opens a new window for future research, showcasing the deep learning-based methods' huge potential for accurate hyperspectral data classification.},

Abstract – DOAS - tomography is a remote sensing technique to retrieve 2 or 3 dimensional distributions of atmospheric trace gas concentrations . It combines Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy yielding average concentrations of trace gases along long light paths with reconstruction methods from computerised tomography . Here we refer to reconstructions from ground based measurements using artificial light sources . We present our reconstruction method , consisting in a discrete approach , and show that for locally confined distributions like dispersions plumes , reconstruction quality and reconstructed total concentrations can be tremendously improved by choosing an optimal parametrisation in terms of basis functions and dimension of the discretisation grid . Choice of the light path geometry has large influence as well , where for constant number of light paths , increasing the number of emitting systems tends to improve reconstructions . The method is applied to data from an indoor measurement and results are in good agreement with expectations , while the impact of measurement errors is moderate . This method will be applied to an experiment intended to measure cross sections of trace gas distributions over the city centre of Heidelberg , Germany , taking place in spring and summer 2005 .},

abstract = {Tomographic Target Light scattering – Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (ToTaL-DOAS), also called Target-DOAS, is a novel experimental procedure to retrieve trace gas concentrations present in the low atmosphere. Scattered sunlight (partially or totally) reflected from natural or artificial targets of similar albedo located at different 5 distances is analyzed to retrieve the concentration of different trace gases like NO 2 , SO 2 and others. We report high spatial resolution measurements of NO 2 mixing ratios in the city of Montevideo (Uruguay) observing three buildings as targets with a Mini-DOAS instrument. Our instrument was 146 m apart from the first building, 196 m from the second and 286 m from the third one. All three buildings are located along a main 10 Avenue. We obtain temporal variation of NO 2 mixing ratios between 30 ppb and 65 ppb (±2 ppb). Our measurements demonstrate that ToTaL-DOAS measurements can be made over very short distances. In polluted air masses, the retrieved absorption signal was found to be strong enough to allow measurements over distances in the range of several ten meters, and achieve a spatial resolution of 50 m approximately.},

In this Review, we focus on the major constituents of air pollutants and their impacts on chronic respiratory diseases. We highlight targets for interventions and recommendations for pollution reduction through industrial upgrading, vehicle and fuel renovation, improvements in public transportation, lowering of personal exposure, mitigation of the direct effects of air pollution through healthy city development, intervention at population-based level (systematic health education, intensive and individualised intervention, pre-emptive measures, and rehabilitation), and improvement in air quality.

abstract = {More than twenty years have passed since the concept of combining Computed Tomography (CT) and Optical Remote Sensing (ORS) was first suggested to map air contaminants. However, there have been no commercial applications of CT-ORS due to a variety of reasons including hardware limitations and slow acceptance by the occupational and environmental scientific communities. A CT-ORS monitoring system provides the potential for near real-time mapping of multiple gases over large areas. Notjust another nifty tool, this technology represents a major departure from conventional sampling methods and could allow us to understand chemical transport and exposure in ways, which are unavailable using conventional methods. Yet critical questions remain unanswered: which contaminant sources are most appropriate for this technology and how does this data apply to human exposure assessment? We discuss potential applications of CT-ORS, such as using open-path Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy for mapping leaks and evaluating worker exposures and quantifying emission flux from a process facility. Large scale ({\textgreater} 1km) CT reconstructions could be obtained from a variety of ORS devices (Tunable Diode Laser, Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy, or Differential Absorptioii Lidar). Reconstructions could help locate industrial emissions and provide improved estimates of pollutant transport.},

The approach combines path-integrated concentration data acquired with any path-integrated optical remote sensing (PI-ORS) technique and computed tomography (CT) technique. In this study, an open-path Fourier transform infrared (OP-FTIR) instrument sampled path-integrated concentrations along five radial beam paths in a vertical plane downwind from the source. A meteorological station collected measurements of wind direction and wind speed. Nitrous oxide (N2O) was released from a controlled area source simulator. The innovative CT technique, which applies the smooth basis function minimization method to the beam data in conjunction with measured wind data, was used to estimate the total flux from the simulated area source. The new approach estimates consistently underestimated the true emission rates in unstable atmospheric conditions and agreed with the true emission rate in neutral atmospheric conditions. This approach is applicable to many types of industrial areas or volume sources, given the use of an adequate PI-ORS system.},

A systematic literature review is a means of evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular research question, topic area, or phenomenon of interest. Systematic reviews aim to present a fair evaluation of a research topic by using a trustworthy, rigorous, and auditable methodology. The guidelines presented in this report were derived from three existing guidelines used by medical researchers, two books produced by researchers with social science backgrounds and discussions with researchers from other disciplines who are involved in evidence-based practice. The guidelines have been adapted to reflect the specific problems of software engineering research. The guidelines cover three phases of a systematic literature review: planning the review, conducting the review and reporting the review. They provide a relatively high level description. They do not consider the impact of the research questions on the review procedures, nor do they specify in detail the mechanisms needed to perform meta-analysis.},

@article{Miller2016,
abstract = {Background The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists places special emphasis on autopsy as one of the most important tests for evaluation of stillbirth. Despite a recommendation of an autopsy, many families will decline the autopsy based on religious/cultural beliefs, fear of additional suffering for the child, or belief that no additional information will be obtained or of value. Further, many obstetric providers express a myriad of barriers limiting their recommendation for a perinatal autopsy despite their understanding of its value. Consequently, perinatal autopsy rates have been declining. Without the information provided by an autopsy, many women are left with unanswered questions regarding cause of death for their fetus and without clear management strategies to reduce the risk of stillbirth in future pregnancies. To avoid this scenario, it is imperative that clinicians are knowledgeable about the benefit of autopsy so they can provide clear information on its diagnostic utility and decrease potential barriers; in so doing the obstetrician can ensure that each family has the necessary information to make an informed decision. Objective We sought to quantify the contribution of placental pathologic examination and autopsy in identifying a cause of stillbirth and to identify how often clinical management is modified due to each result. Study Design This is a cohort study of all cases of stillbirth from 2009 through 2013 at a single tertiary care center. Records were reviewed in a stepwise manner: first the clinical history and laboratory results, then the placental pathologic evaluation, and finally the autopsy. At each step, a cause of death and the certainty of that etiology were coded. Clinical changes that would be recommended by information available at each step were also recorded. Results Among the 144 cases of stillbirth examined, 104 (72{\%}) underwent autopsy and these cases constitute the cohort of study. The clinical and laboratory information alone identified a cause of death in 35 (24{\%}). After placental pathologic examination, 88 (61{\%}) cases had a probable cause of death identified. The addition of autopsy resulted in 78 (74{\%}) cases having an identifiable probable cause of death. Placental examination alone changed clinical management in 52 (36{\%}) cases. Autopsy led to additional clinical management changes in 6 (6{\%}) cases. Conclusion This stepwise assessment of the benefit of both placental pathological examination and autopsy in changing probable cause of death beyond traditional clinical history and laboratory results emphasizes the need to implement more comprehensive evaluation of all stillbirths. With the aim of providing a cause of stillbirth to the parents, and to prevent future stillbirths, it behooves health care professionals to understand the value of this more comprehensive approach and convey that information to the bereaved parents.},

@article{Kastis2012,
abstract = {An efficient, two-dimensional, analytic, Spline Reconstruction Technique (SRT) for SPECT has been presented earlier in the literature. The SRT is a reconstruction algorithm based on an analytic formula of the inverse Attenuated Radon Transform which results from the approximation of the sinogram in terms of cubic splines. The algorithm incorporates the attenuation map obtained by a CT scan, to provide attenuation corrected images. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of the SRT algorithm, using phantoms and real SPECT/CT data, by comparing it with two commonly used reconstruction algorithms: FBP and OSEM. The uniformity and resolution limitations of the analytic SRT algorithm is assessed in simulation studies by using a Uniformity phantom, a slice of the Hoffman brain phantom, and two slices of the NCAT human torso phantom. Appropriate attenuation maps are used for each image. Reconstructed images are obtained for 60, 90, 120, and 180 projections over 360 degrees. Furthermore, real SPECT sinograms and their corresponding CT images are acquired from a clinical SPECT/CT system, and then reconstructed employing the SRT algorithm. The reconstructed images obtained via the SRT algorithm are compared to those produced by FBP and OSEM. Several profiles are presented which illustrate the ability of SRT algorithm to correct for attenuation. The SRT reconstructions from clinical data are also compared with the OSEM reconstructions provided by the commercial system. Comparisons between fused images are also presented. Our preliminary results suggest that SRT appears to provide better reconstructed images than FBP at least for the cases when no attenuation correction is applied to FBP. The reconstruction time for SRT was about 2 sec which is comparable to that of FBP and faster than OSEM. Regarding reconstructions for the data obtained from the clinical system, SRT appears to provide comparable quality images with the OSEM reconstructions processed by the comme- cial system. However, further evaluation of SRT is needed to substantiate this claim. It is also important to note that SRT suffers from striking artifacts, due to angular under-sampling, which become worse at low number of projection angles.},

The wide variety of pollutants released by wildland fire include greenhouse gases, photochemically reactive compounds, and fine and coarse particulate matter. Through direct emissions and secondary chemical and physical processes, wildland fire can have a significant impact on tropospheric chemistry and serve as a major source of air pollution. We provide a synthesis of emission factor data from the literature and previously unpublished research for use in global, continental and regional scale studies investigating the role of wildland fire emissions in atmospheric chemistry and climate. The emission factor data is presented by geographic zones (boreal, temperate, and tropical) and vegetation group (forest and savanna/rangeland), allowing researchers to account for the different emission characteristics exhibited by biomass burning in these disparate regions. A brief overview of the wildland fuel combustion process as related to emissions production is also provided. The atmospheric fate of wildland fire emissions is briefly discussed and related to the production of secondary air pollutants.

The rate has decreased in the UK over recent years but at a slower pace than other similar high-income countries. The association of certain risk factors (including maternal age, previous poor obstetric outcome, smoking and obesity) is clearly documented, though only a number of these factors can be modified. Use of interventions including the ‘Saving Babies Lives' Care Bundle focussing on smoking cessation, assessment for small for gestational age (SGA) babies, educating women regarding reduced fetal movements and effective fetal monitoring during labour aim to reduce both antenatal and intrapartum stillbirth. As yet, it remains difficult to predict which pregnancies are at greatest risk of stillbirth but with further research, ongoing improvements in antenatal and intrapartum care, and improved patient education, it is anticipated that the incidence in the UK can be substantially reduced.},

abstract = {Abstract To demonstrate the usefulness of active remote-sensing systems in observing forest fire plume behavior, we studied two fires, one using a 3.2-cm-wavelength Doppler radar, and one more extensively, using Doppler lidar. Both instruments observed the kinematics of the convection column, including the presence of two different types of rotation in the columns, and monitored the behavior of the smoke plume. The first fire, a forest fire that burned out of control, was observed by the Doppler radar during late-morning and afternoon hours. Strong horizontal ambient winds produced a bent-over convection column, which the radar observed to have strong horizontal flow at its edges and weaker flow along the centerline of the plume. This velocity pattern implies that the column consisted of a pair of counterrotating horizontal vortices (rolls), with rising motion along the centerline and sinking along the edges. The radar tracked the smoke plume for over 30 km. It also provided circular depolarization ratio measurements, which gave information that the scattering particles were mostly flat or needle shaped as viewed by the radar, perhaps pine needles or possibly flat ash platelets being viewed edge on. The second fire, observed over a 5-h period by Doppler lidar, was a prescribed forest fire ignited in the afternoon. During the first hour of the fire the lidar observed many kinematic quantities of the convection column, including flow convergence and anticyclonic whole-column, rotation of the nearly vertical column, with a vorticity of approximately 10?2 s?1 and an estimated peak vertical velocity w of 1 5 m s?1. After the first hour ambient meteorological conditions changed, the whole-column rotation ceased, and the convection column and smoke plume bent over toward the lidar in stronger horizontal flow. At two times during this later stage, w was estimated to be 24 and 10 m s?1. Lidar observations show that the smoke plume of this second fire initially went straight up in the convection column to heights of over 2 km, so most of the smoke was injected into the atmosphere above the unstable, afternoon, convective boundary layer, or mixed layer. Later, as the horizontal winds increased, a larger friction of the smoke remained in the mixed layer. Finally, very late in the afternoon, after ignitions had ceased and the fire was smoldering, almost all of the smoke remained within the mixed layer. These analyses show that lidar and radar can provide valuable three-dimensional datasets on kinematic quantities and smoke distribution in the vicinity of fires. This kind of information should be of great value in understanding and modeling convection-column dynamics and smoke-plume behavior.},

abstract = {This report summarizes the most recent information on the health effects of air pollution. It is based on the results of a comprehensive review of scientific evidence organized by the World Health Organization in support of air pollution policy development in Europe, and in particular the European Commission's Clean Air for Europe (CAFE) programme. The review indicates that air pollution at current levels still poses a considerable burden on health in Europe. Many different adverse effects have been linked to exposure to air pollution, including an increased risk of cardiopulmonary disease and a reduction in life expectancy of a year or more for people living in European cities. Some of these effects occur at very low concentrations that were previously considered safe. Taken together, the evidence is sufficient to strongly recommend further policy action to reduce levels of air pollutants, including particulates, nitrogen dioxide and ozone. It is reasonable to assume that a reduction in air pollution will lead to considerable health benefits},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The London smog of 1952 is one of history's most important air pollution episodes in terms of its impact on science, public perception of air pollution, and government regulation. The association between health and air pollution during the episode was evident as a strong rise in air pollution levels was immediately followed by sharp increases in mortality and morbidity. However, mortality in the months after the smog was also elevated above normal levels. An initial government report proposed the hypothesis that influenza was responsible for high mortality during these months. Estimates of the number of influenza deaths were generated using multiple methods, indicating that only a fraction of the deaths in the months after the smog could be attributable to influenza. Sensitivity analysis reveals that only an extremely severe influenza epidemic could account for the majority of the excess deaths for this time period. Such an epidemic would be on the order of twice the case-fatality rate and quadruple the incidence observed in a general medical practice during the winter of 1953. These results underscore the need for diligence regarding extremely high air pollution that still exists in many parts of the world.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

abstract = {A recent development in ground-based remote sensing of atmospheric constituents by UV/visible absorp-tion measurements of scattered light is the simultaneous use of several directions with small elevation angles in addition to the traditional zenith-sky pointing. The different light paths through the atmosphere enable the vertical distribution of some atmospheric absorbers such as NO 2 , BrO or O 3 to be retrieved. In this study, the amount of profile information that can be retrieved from such measurements on aircraft is investigated for the trace gas NO 2 . A Sensitivity study on synthetic data is performed for a combination of four lines of sight (LOS) (0 • (nadir), 88 • , 92 • , and 180 • (zenith)) and three wave-length regions [center wavelengths: 362.5 nm, 437.5 nm, and 485.0 nm]. The method used in this work is a com-bination of two previously established methods described in Petritoli et al. (2002) and Wang et al. (2004). The in-vestigation presented here demonstrates the potential of this LOS/wavelengths setup to retrieve a significant amount of profile information from airborne multiax is differential op-tical absorption spectrometer (AMAXDOAS) measurements with a vertical resolution of 3.0 to 4.5 km in the lower tropo-sphere and 2.0 to 3.5 km near flight altitude. Above 13 km the profile information content of AMAXDOAS measurements is sparse. The retrieval algorithm used in this work is the AMAXDOAS profile retrievalalgorithm (APROVAL). Further, retrieved profiles with a significant amount (up to 3.2 ppbv) of NO 2 in the boundary layer over the Po-valley (Italy) are presented. Airborne multiaxis measurements are thus a promising tool for atmospheric studies in the tropo-sphere.},

abstract = {In this research, it is hypothesized that recently developed theoretical considerations of atmospheric radiative transfer in horizontally in-homogeneous atmospheres can be applied to the remote measurement of anthropogenic plumes. To this end, a MAX-DOAS spectrometer, designed around a B{\&}W-TEK BTU142 spectrometer was constructed and characterized. It was found that the MAX-DOAS spectrometer has a measured resolution of 0.282 nm, and a noise level of 178 counts at 75{\%} pixel saturation, sufficient to resolve accurately the absorptions of important atmospheric species, including SO2, NO2, HCHO, and O4. The theory of MAX-DOAS spectral analysis was examined in detail, in particular the processing of reference absorption cross-section spectra for use in regression analyses of scattered solar radiation. For the purposes of inversion, optimal estimation software was designed and investigated for suitability in retrieving vertical profiles of atmospheric species. This software is shown to perform well under conditions of both typical and non-typical noise levels using synthetic spectral data and known profiles of three atmospheric species. Furthermore, an extensive examination of the residuals of DOAS spectral analysis was performed, to validate the assumption of normally distributed errors in the inversion process. Investigated methodologies were applied to spectral data collected over nine days in 2008 in the Upper Ohio River Valley. Aerosol extinction coefficient profiles were successfully retrieved, with an average peak value of 0.549 km-1. For the same measurement period, in-plume measurements of SO2 and NO2 concentration from a coal-fired power plant were conducted using recently developed methodologies to account for in-plume solar radiative transfer effects.},

abstract = {Objectives Air pollution is an important public health concern especially for children who are particularly susceptible. Latin America has a large children population, is highly urbanized and levels of pollution are substantially high, making the potential health impact of air pollution quite large. We evaluated the effect of air pollution on children respiratory mortality in four large urban centers: Mexico City, Santiago, Chile, and Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. Methods Generalized Additive Models in Poisson regression was used to fit daily time-series of mortality due to respiratory diseases in infants and children, and levels of PM10 and O3. Single lag and constrained polynomial distributed lag models were explored. Analyses were carried out per cause for each age group and each city. Fixed- and random-effects meta-analysis was conducted in order to combine the city-specific results in a single summary estimate. Results These cities host nearly 43 million people and pollution levels were above the WHO guidelines. For PM10 the percentage increase in risk of death due to respiratory diseases in infants in a fixed effect model was 0.47{\%} (0.09–0.85). For respiratory deaths in children 1–5 years old, the increase in risk was 0.58{\%} (0.08–1.08) while a higher effect was observed for lower respiratory infections (LRI) in children 1–14 years old [1.38{\%} (0.91–1.85)]. For O3, the only summarized estimate statistically significant was for LRI in infants. Analysis by season showed effects of O3 in the warm season for respiratory diseases in infants, while negative effects were observed for respiratory and LRI deaths in children. Discussion We provided comparable mortality impact estimates of air pollutants across these cities and age groups. This information is important because many public policies aimed at preventing the adverse effects of pollution on health consider children as the population group that deserves the highest protection. Air pollution has important impact on children and infant mortality in Latin-American cities with PM10 and to a lesser degree O3 were associated with respiratory deaths.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: An emerging body of evidence has raised concern regarding the potentially harmful effects of inhaled pollutants on the central nervous system during the last decade. In the general population, traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) exposure has been associated with adverse effects on cognitive, behavior, and psychomotor development in children, and with cognitive decline and higher risk of dementia in the elderly. Recently, studies have interfaced environmental epidemiology with magnetic resonance imaging to investigate in vivo the effects of TRAP on the human brain. The aim of this systematic review was to describe and synthesize the findings from these studies. The bibliographic search was carried out in PubMed with ad hoc keywords. RECENT FINDINGS: The selected studies revealed that cerebral white matter, cortical gray matter, and basal ganglia might be the targets of TRAP. The detected brain damages could be involved in cognition changes. The effect of TRAP on cognition appears to be biologically plausible. Interfacing environmental epidemiology and neuroimaging is an emerging field with room for improvement. Future studies, together with inputs from experimental findings, should provide more relevant and detailed knowledge about the nature of the relationship between TRAP exposure and cognitive, behavior, and psychomotor disorders observed in the general population.},

abstract = {Measurement of gas concentrations in indoor air using optical remote sensing (ORS) and computed tomography (CT) has been suggested but not thoroughly investigated. We present experiments in which one time-varying and 11 different steady-state tracer-gas concentration profiles were generated in a ventilated chamber and sampled in a horizontal plane by an open-path Fourier transform infrared (OP-FTIR) spectrometer for subsequent CT inversion. CT reconstructions were performed using the recently developed smooth basis function minimization (SBFM) technique. The CT reconstructions were compared with simultaneously gathered point-sample concentration measurements. Agreement between the two sampling methods was qualitatively very good, with concentration profiles generated by both methods showing the same features of peak location and shape. Quantitative agreement was generally good to within 50{\%}. We discuss the sources of discrepancy and suggest directions for future research, especially with regard to monitoring time-dependent processes. With further refinements in the SBFM algorithm and improvements in optical remote sensing hardware, this technique promises to yield rapid and accurate measurements of the spatial distribution of gases in indoor environments.},

abstract = {The consequences of air pollution scenarios caused by road traffic or the impact of exhaust gas reduction techniques are estimated by emission models. To ensure the quality of model results, it is necessary to evaluate the used emission factors under real-world conditions. Therefore, the Institut f{\"{u}}r Meteorologie und Klimaforschung (IMK) of the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe initiated the field campaign BAB II (BundesAutoBahn, Federal motorway). The campaign was conducted in May 2001 with the objective of measuring the traffic emissions at a motorway section and to compare them to modelled emissions. Based on experiences during a precursor campaign (BAB I, 1997), a symmetric experimental set-up was installed which allowed measurements up- and downwind of a motorway nearby Heidelberg, Germany. This paper focuses on the determination of source intensities and emission factors for CO and NOx, whereas other papers in this issue handle VOC and particulate matter. First the basic approach of BAB II measurements up- and downwind of a motorway was approved, showing that it is possible to detect the plume originating from traffic emissions. A case study during a traffic jam illustrates that driving patterns have a strong impact on the emissions and therefore a detailed traffic census is required to obtain reliable emission calculations. Two different strategies were used: (i) long-time measurements during the whole campaign to obtain vertical profiles each 30 min and (ii) measurements during eight special operation periods (SOP) in a higher temporal resolution of 5 min, using instrumentation in elevators. It could be shown that even at a distance of 60-80 m from the motorway the structure of the plume is still inhomogeneous, and concentration changes within short times. The inhomogeneity of the plume not only affects the temporal scale, the spatial scale is also influenced and frequently concentration maxima in higher altitudes are observed. Mean source intensities of 9.5 kg km-1 h-1 CO and 4.4 kg km -1 h-1 NOx on working days have been calculated. The ratio of CO/NOx was found to be 2.1 on working days and 4.5 on weekends and holidays. Emission factors of 2.62 g km-1 veh-1 CO and 1.08 g km-1 veh-1 NOx have been determined, which agrees well with results derived from similar studies. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Optical remote sensing and iterative computed tomography (CT) can be applied to measure the spatial distribution of gaseous pollutant concentrations. We conducted chamber experiments to test this combination of techniques using an open path Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (OP-FTIR) and a standard algebraic reconstruction technique (ART). Although ART converged to solutions that showed excellent agreement with the measured ray-integral concentrations, the solutions were inconsistent with simultaneously gathered point-sample concentration measurements. A new CT method was developed that combines (1) the superposition of bivariate Gaussians to represent the concentration distribution and (2) a simulated annealing minimization routine to find the parameters of the Gaussian basis functions that result in the best fit to the ray-integral concentration data. This method, named smooth basis function minimization (SBFM), generated reconstructions that agreed well, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with the concentration profiles generated from point sampling. We present an analysis of two sets of experimental data that compares the performance of ART and SBFM. We conclude that SBFM is a superior CT reconstruction method for practical indoor and outdoor air monitoring applications.},

abstract = {A novel experimental procedure to measure the near-surface distribution of atmospheric trace gases by using passive multiaxis differential absorption optical spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) is proposed. The procedure consists of pointing the receiving telescope of the spectrometer to nonreflecting surfaces or to bright targets placed at known distances from the measuring device, which are illuminated by sunlight. We show that the partial trace gas absorptions between the top of the atmosphere and the target can be easily removed from the measured total absorption. Thus it is possible to derive the average concentration of trace gases such as NO(2), HCHO, SO(2), H(2)O, Glyoxal, BrO, and others along the line of sight between the instrument and the target similar to the well-known long-path DOAS observations (but with much less expense). If tomographic arrangements are used, even two- or three-dimensional trace gas distributions can be retrieved. The basic assumptions of the proposed method are confirmed by test measurements taken across the city of Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Aromatic hydrocarbons are well known air toxics which are regulated by the US EPA and other air quality agencies. Accurate, long-term monitoring of these compounds at low part-per-billion levels, as well as identifying emission point sources is therefore crucial to protect human health in neighborhoods near large emission sources. Here we present a new long-path differential optical absorption spectroscopy (LP-DOAS) instrument specifically designed to monitor aromatic hydrocarbons. The system is based on a novel dual - light emitting diode (LED) light source, which eliminates the requirement to suppress spectrometer stray light. This light source, together with a high stability fiber-based sending/receiving telescope, allows the measurement of aromatic hydrocarbons on once-folded absorptions paths of 200–1200 m length. The new instrument shows very good agreement with simultaneous in-situ measurements if inhomogeneities of the trace gas spatial distributions are considered. The new instrument performed well during a three-month field test as an automated fence-line monitor at a refinery, successfully distinguishing upwind background levels of ∼1 ppb from emissions reflected in elevated mixing ratios of 3–4 ppb. A two-dimensional measurement network based on two identical LP-DOAS instruments operating on seven crossed light paths was operated successfully in Houston, TX. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of two events with toluene and xylene plumes demonstrate how this setup can be used to derive the spatial distribution of aromatic hydrocarbons, and identify point sources.},

abstract = {Context: In recent years, many usability evaluation methods (UEMs) have been employed to evaluate Web applications. However, many of these applications still do not meet most customers' usability expectations and many companies have folded as a result of not considering Web usability issues. No studies currently exist with regard to either the use of usability evaluation methods for the Web or the benefits they bring. Objective: The objective of this paper is to summarize the current knowledge that is available as regards the usability evaluation methods (UEMs) that have been employed to evaluate Web applications over the last 14 years. Method: A systematic mapping study was performed to assess the UEMs that have been used by researchers to evaluate Web applications and their relation to the Web development process. Systematic mapping studies are useful for categorizing and summarizing the existing information concerning a research question in an unbiased manner. Results: The results show that around 39{\%} of the papers reviewed reported the use of evaluation methods that had been specifically crafted for the Web. The results also show that the type of method most widely used was that of User Testing. The results identify several research gaps, such as the fact that around 90{\%} of the studies applied evaluations during the implementation phase of the Web application development, which is the most costly phase in which to perform changes. A list of the UEMs that were found is also provided in order to guide novice usability practitioners. Conclusions: From an initial set of 2703 papers, a total of 206 research papers were selected for the mapping study. The results obtained allowed us to reach conclusions concerning the state-of-the-art of UEMs for evaluating Web applications. This allowed us to identify several research gaps, which subsequently provided us with a framework in which new research activities can be more appropriately positioned, and from which useful information for novice usability practitioners can be extracted. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The main idea presented in this paper is to utilize animals with sensors as Mobile Biological Sensors (MBS). The devices used in this system are animals which are native animals living in forests, sensors (thermo and radiation sensors with GPS features) that measure the temperature and transmit the location of the MBS, access points for wireless communication and a central computer system which classifies of animal actions. The system offers two different methods, firstly: access points continuously receive data about animals' location using GPS at certain time intervals and the gathered data is then classified and checked to see if there is a sudden movement (panic) of the animal groups: this method is called animal behavior classification (ABC). The second method can be defined as thermal detection (TD): the access points get the temperature values from the MBS devices and send the data to a central computer to check for instant changes in the temperatures. This system may be used for many purposes other than fire detection, namely animal tracking, poaching prevention and detecting instantaneous animal death.},

abstract = {Objective: To quantify how the changing stillbirth risk profile of women is affecting the interpretation of the stillbirth rate. Design: A retrospective, population-based cohort study from 1983 to 2018. Setting: Victoria, Australia. Population: A total of 2 419 923 births at ≥28 weeks of gestation. Methods: Changes in maternal characteristics over time were assessed. A multivariable logistic regression model was developed for stillbirth, based on maternal characteristics in 1983–1987, and used to calculate individual predictive probabilities of stillbirth from the regression equation. The number of expected stillbirths per year as a result of the change in maternal demographics was then calculated, assuming no changes in care and in the associations between maternal characteristics and stillbirth over time. Main outcome measure: Stillbirth. Results: Compared with 1983–1987, there were more women in older age groups giving birth, more nulliparous women, more indigenous women and women born in Oceania, Asia and Africa, more multiple pregnancies and more women with pre-existing diabetes in 2014–2018. Despite this, the rate of stillbirth fell from 5.42 per 1000 births in 1983 to 1.72 per 1000 births in 2018 (P {\textless} 0.001). Applying the multivariable logistic regression equation, derived from the 1983–87 data, to each year, had there been no changes in care or in the associations between maternal characteristics and stillbirth, the rate of stillbirth would have increased by 12{\%}, from 4.94 per 1000 in 1983 to 5.54 per 1000 in 2018, as a result of the change in maternal characteristics. Conclusions: Population rates of stillbirth are falling faster than is generally appreciated.

It combines a "pushbroom" imaging spectrometer with the DOAS technique and thus allows imaging two-dimensional trace gas distributions, e.g., in volcanic plumes. The highly sensitive and specific detection of many trace gases simultaneously (specific molecules, not just elements, e.g. SO2, BrO, NO2, O3, HCHO, etc.) is possible, and the temporal and spatial variation of these gases can be measured. The IDOAS system presented here enables the taking of two-dimensional images of trace gas distributions in a volcanic plume with a spatial resolution of 100 pixels horizontally × 64 pixels vertically, each with a field of view of 0.087° in horizontal and 0.208° in vertical directions. Therefore, IDOAS provides useful information about the chemical composition and chemical variability in a volcanic plume and allows studying plume dispersal and chemical transformations.

abstract = {An estimated 2{\textperiodcentered}6 million third trimester stillbirths occurred in 2015 (uncertainty range 2{\textperiodcentered}4-3{\textperiodcentered}0 million). The number of stillbirths has reduced more slowly than has maternal mortality or mortality in children younger than 5 years, which were explicitly targeted in the Millennium Development Goals. The Every Newborn Action Plan has the target of 12 or fewer stillbirths per 1000 births in every country by 2030. 94 mainly high-income countries and upper middle-income countries have already met this target, although with noticeable disparities. At least 56 countries, particularly in Africa and in areas aff ected by confl ict, will have to more than double present progress to reach this target. Most (98{\%}) stillbirths are in low-income and middle-income countries. Improved care at birth is essential to prevent 1{\textperiodcentered}3 million (uncertainty range 1{\textperiodcentered}2-1{\textperiodcentered}6 million) intrapartum stillbirths, end preventable maternal and neonatal deaths, and improve child development. Estimates for stillbirth causation are impeded by various classifi cation systems, but for 18 countries with reliable data, congenital abnormalities account for a median of only 7{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} of stillbirths. Many disorders associated with stillbirths are potentially modifi able and often coexist, such as maternal infections (population attributable fraction: malaria 8{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} and syphilis 7{\textperiodcentered}7{\%}), non-communicable diseases, nutrition and lifestyle factors (each about 10{\%}), and maternal age older than 35 years (6{\textperiodcentered}7{\%}). Prolonged pregnancies contribute to 14{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} of stillbirths. Causal pathways for stillbirth frequently involve impaired placental function, either with fetal growth restriction or preterm labour, or both. Two-thirds of newborns have their births registered. However, less than 5{\%} of neonatal deaths and even fewer stillbirths have death registration. Records and registrations of all births, stillbirths, neonatal, and maternal deaths in a health facility would substantially increase data availability. Improved data alone will not save lives but provide a way to target interventions to reach more than 7000 women every day worldwide who experience the reality of stillbirth.},

abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28{\%} relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC {\&} COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

abstract = {DOAS-tomography is a remote sensing technique to retrieve 2 or 3 dimensional distributions of atmospheric trace gas concentrations. It combines Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy yielding average concentrations of trace gases along long light paths with reconstruction methods from computerised tomography. Here we refer to reconstructions from ground based measurements using artificial light sources. We present our reconstruction method, consisting in a discrete approach, and show that for locally confined distributions like dispersions plumes, reconstruction quality and reconstructed total concentrations can be tremendously improved by choosing an optimal parametrisation in terms of basis functions and dimension of the discretisation grid. Choice of the light path geometry has large influence as well, where for constant number of light paths, increasing the number of emitting systems tends to improve reconstructions. The method is applied to data from an indoor measurement and results are in good agreement with expectations, while the impact of measurement errors is moderate. This method will be applied to an experiment intended to measure cross sections of trace gas distributions over the city centre of Heidelberg, Germany, taking place in spring and summer 2005.},

abstract = {Exposure to ambient air pollution is a serious and common public health concern associated with growing morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the last decades, the adverse effects of air pollution on the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems have been well established in a series of major epidemiological and observational studies. In the recent past, air pollution has also been associated with diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), including stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and neurodevelopmental disorders. It has been demonstrated that various components of air pollution, such as nanosized particles, can easily translocate to the CNS where they can activate innate immune responses. Furthermore, systemic inflammation arising from the pulmonary or cardiovascular system can affect CNS health. Despite intense studies on the health effects of ambient air pollution, the underlying molecular mechanisms of susceptibility and disease remain largely elusive. However, emerging evidence suggests that air pollution-induced neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, microglial activation, cerebrovascular dysfunction, and alterations in the blood-brain barrier contribute to CNS pathology. A better understanding of the mediators and mechanisms will enable the development of new strategies to protect individuals at risk and to reduce detrimental effects of air pollution on the nervous system and mental health.

abstract = {Air pollution is a heterogeneous mixture of gases, liquids and PM (particulate matter). In the modern urban world, PM is principally derived from fossil fuel combustion with individual constituents varying in size from a few nanometres to 10 $\mu$m in diameter. In addition to the ambient concentration, the pollution source and chemical composition may play roles in determining the biological toxicity and subsequent health effects. Nevertheless, studies from across the world have consistently shown that both short- and long-term exposures to PM are associated with a host of cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial ischaemia and infarctions, heart failure, arrhythmias, strokes and increased cardiovascular mortality. Evidence from cellular/toxicological experiments, controlled animal and human exposures and human panel studies have demonstrated several mechanisms by which particle exposure may both trigger acute events as well as prompt the chronic development of cardiovascular diseases. PM inhaled into the pulmonary tree may instigate remote cardiovascular health effects via three general pathways: instigation of systemic inflammation and/or oxidative stress, alterations in autonomic balance, and potentially by direct actions upon the vasculature of particle constituents capable of reaching the systemic circulation. In turn, these responses have been shown to trigger acute arterial vasoconstriction, endothelial dysfunction, arrhythmias and pro-coagulant/thrombotic actions. Finally, long-term exposure has been shown to enhance the chronic genesis of atherosclerosis. Although the risk to one individual at any single time point is small, given the prodigious number of people continuously exposed, PM air pollution imparts a tremendous burden to the global public health, ranking it as the 13th leading cause of morality (approx. 800000 annual deaths). {\textcopyright} The Authors.},

abstract = {Forest fires represent a constant threat to ecological systems, infrastructure and human lives. The only effective way to minimize damage caused by forest fires is their early detection and fast reaction, apart from preventive measures. Great efforts are therefore made to achieve early forest fire detection, which is traditionally based on human surveillance. There are two types of human surveillance – direct human observation by observers located on monitoring spots and distant human observation based on video surveillance systems. More advanced approach is automatic surveillance and automatic early forest fire detection. Today there are several different approaches but the most feasible is the system based on video cameras sensible in visible spectra. In almost every country which encounters high risk of forest fires at least one such system was developed and proposed. Some of them are on the market under various commercial names. Croatia also has its own system called Integral Forest Fire Monitoring System (in Croatian IPNAS) developed at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture University of Split. The system was experimentally tested during 2005 and 2006 fire seasons on three locations in Split and Dalmatia County (Marjan Split Vidova gora Bra{\v{c}} and faculty building Split) but it is also in everyday use in National Park Paklenica from June 2006. This paper describes the main idea behind the Croatian system IPNAS and discusses our experiences during its field tests period in 2005 and 2006.},

The aim of this experimentation is to discover novel risk models that could be utilized in a clinical setting. A CDC data set of almost sixteen million observations was used conduct feature selection, parameter optimization and verification of proposed models. An additional NYC data set was used for external validation. Algorithms such as logistic regression, artificial neural network and gradient boosting decision tree were used to construct individual classifiers. Ensemble learning strategies of these classifiers were also experimented with. The best performing machine learning models achieved 0.76 AUC for early stillbirth, 0.63 for late stillbirth and 0.64 for preterm birth while using a external NYC test data. The repeatable performance of our models demonstrates robustness that is required in this context. Our proposed novel models provide a solid foundation for risk prediction and could be further improved with the addition of biochemical and/or biophysical markers.},

The experiment was conducted over an area of 10 m × 15 m using one and two cylindrical polycarbonate containers of diameter 2 m, respectively, filled with NO2. The setup was realized with three of the multibeam instruments recently developed by Pundt and Mettendorf (Appl. Opt., 2005, in press),1 which allow the simultaneous measurement along at least four light paths each. The configuration consisted of twelve simultaneous light beams, 39 horizontal light paths in total, and 18 different cylinder positions inside the field. It was found that for the discretization and inversion technique shown here reconstructions of the concentration distributions from experimental data agree well with simulated reconstructions. In order to draw conclusions for atmospheric applications, numerical studies including instrumental errors were carried out. It was found that with the presented measurement setup it is possible to measure and reconstruct one or two NO 2 plumes of 600 m diameter and average concentrations above 4.2 ppbv each, on a scale of 13.5 km2. Theoretical investigations show that it should be possible to localize and quantify 600 m diameter plumes of SO 2 {\textgreater} 1.5 ppbv, H2CO {\textgreater} 6.3 ppbv, HONO {\textgreater} 3.2 ppbv, and ozone {\textgreater} 46.2 ppbv.

abstract = {There is widespread use of passive remote sensing techniques to quantify trace gas column densities in volcanic plumes utilizing scattered sunlight as a light source. Examples include passive DOAS, COSPEC, and the SO2 camera. In order to calculate trace gas concentrations or volcanic emission fluxes, knowledge about the optical path through the plume is necessary. In the past, a straight photon path through the plume has always been assumed although it was known that this is not always true. Here we present the results of model studies conducted specifically to quantify the effects of realistic radiative transfer in and around volcanic plumes on ground-based remote sensing measurements of SO2. The results show that measurements conducted without additional information on average photon paths can be inaccurate under certain conditions, with possible errors spanning more than an order of magnitude. Both over and underestimation of the true column density can occur. Actual errors depend on parameters such as distance between instrument and plume, plume SO2 concentration, plume aerosol load, as well as aerosol conditions in the ambient atmosphere. As an example, a measurement conducted with an SO2 camera is discussed, the results of which can only be correctly interpreted if realistic radiative transfer is considered. Finally, a method is presented which for the first time allows the retrieval of actual average photon paths in spectroscopic (i. e. DOAS) measurements of adequate resolution. By allowing for a wavelength dependent column density during the evaluation of DOAS measurements, we show how radiative transfer effects can be corrected using information inherently available in the measured spectra, thus greatly enhancing the accuracy of DOAS measurements of volcanic emissions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Field experiments were carried out in the vicinity of an isolated building using open-path and point monitoring air pollution detectors to measure concentrations of a tracer gas released from a source located either on the building or at the downwind face of the building. Experiments were conducted under neutral or slightly unstable weather conditions. Either three or five fast-response point monitors were located along the beam path of an open-path instrument, in the wake of the build-ing. Experiments were performed with different source locations, detector locations and building orientations to the wind. Visual comparison of data time series showed that data from the two types of instruments followed similar trends. The best degree of correlation occurred for an averaging time similar to the response time of the open-path monitor. Mean concentrations detected by the open-path instrument were generally in very good agreement with the path averaged mean concentrations from the point monitors. The point monitors were also capable of providing time-resolved data needed to describe detailed concentration fluctuation statistics.},

A configuration of three Multibeam Long path DOAS Instruments and almost 20 different light paths to retro reflector arrays will be used in spring 2005 for 2D measurements of NO 2 , SO 2 , O 3 , HCHO, and HONO over an area of a few square km above the city center of Heidelberg. With each of the telescopes it is possible to measure along up to six light paths at once. Later measurements at shorter wavelength will be performed to investigate the concentrations of the aromatic compounds Benzene, Toluene and X-Phenol. The 2D trace gas distributions will be obtained using reconstruction techniques.},

abstract = {Stillbirth definitions vary between countries around the globe. The purpose of this paper was to explore stillbirth definitions used by high income countries around the world, specifically compared to Ireland, their stillbirth and mortality rates and to examine how these rates are influenced by standards of care, especially resuscitation efforts within the delivery room for very preterm infants. A literature review was performed using PubMed, Academic Search Complete, MEDLINE, and CINAHL. These databases were searched with the terms “(stillbirth OR still birth OR stillborn) AND (definition OR registration OR registry)” and “(fetal OR neonatal OR neonate) AND Viability AND Gestational Age” in two separate searches. The database searches returned 1081 results involving stillbirths and 164 results for neonatal viability. After title, abstract, full text review, and reference review 33 papers remained for use in this study. Within the European Union (EU), 59.2 {\%} (n = 16), 14.8 {\%} (n = 4), 11.1 {\%} (n = 3), and 3.7 {\%} (n = 1) countries classify stillbirths at gestational ages of ≥22 weeks, ≥24 weeks, ≥28 weeks, and ≥180 gestational days respectively. The median stillbirth rate in Europe using ≥28 weeks gestational age as a cut-off was 2.7 per 1000 births, but this increased to 3.3 per 1000 births when stillbirths from 24 to 27 weeks gestation were included. Of the thirteen countries whose mortality data was examined, survival rates for liveborn infants ranged from 0–37.3 {\%}, 1.1–64.5 {\%}, 31.0–77.7 {\%}, and 59.1–85.7 {\%} for the gestational ages of 22, 23, 24, and 25 weeks, respectively. In 1995, survival rates for the United Kingdom and Ireland were only 26 {\%} for those born at 24 weeks gestation, however this has almost doubled in Ireland to 56.6 {\%} in 2014–2017. Survival rates have improved to the point that, in 2014–2017, the survival rate of infants born at 23 weeks gestation (32.3 {\%}) was 6 {\%} higher than the rate for those born at 24 weeks gestation in 1995. Due to the improvement in survival rates, multiple international organisations recommend recording stillbirths from 22 weeks gestation and/or 500 g. Based on the findings from this review, and due to improving survival rates for periviable infants, it is recommended the stillbirth definition in Ireland should be updated to ≥22 weeks' gestation and ≥400 g to comply with improved medical developments.},

abstract = {Fires are an important factor in shaping Earth's ecosystems. Plant and animal life, in almost every land habitat, are at least partially dependant on the effects of fire. However, their destructive force, which many times has proven itself uncontrollable, is one of our greatest concerns, effectively originating several policies in the most important industrialised regions of the globe. This paper aims to comprehensively characterise the Forest Fire Finder (FFF), a forest fire detection system based mainly upon a spectroscopic technique called Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS). The system is designed and configured with the goal of detecting higher-than-the-horizon smoke columns by measuring and comparing scattered sunlight spectra. The article covers hardware and software, as well as their interactions and specific algorithms for day mode operation. An analysis of data retrieved from several installations deployed in the course of the last five years, is also presented. Finally, this document features a discussion on the most prominent future improvements planned for the system, as well as its ramifications and adaptations, such as a thermal imaging system for short range fire seeking or environmental quality control.},

abstract = {The results of a comparison exercise of radiative transfer models (RTM) of various international research groups for Multiple AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) viewing geometry are presented. Besides the assessment of the agreement between the different models, a second focus of the comparison was the systematic investigation of the sensitivity of the MAX-DOAS technique under various viewing geometries and aerosol conditions. In contrast to previous comparison exercises, box-air-mass-factors (box-AMFs) for different atmospheric height layers were modelled, which describe the sensitivity of the measurements as a function of altitude. In addition, radiances were calculated allowing the identification of potential errors, which might be overlooked if only AMFs are compared. Accurate modelling of radiances is also a prerequisite for the correct interpretation of satellite observations, for which the received radiance can strongly vary across the large ground pixels, and might be also important for the retrieval of aerosol properties as a future application of MAX-DOAS. The comparison exercises included different wavelengths and atmospheric scenarios ( with and without aerosols). The strong and systematic influence of aerosol scattering indicates that from MAX-DOAS observations also information on atmospheric aerosols can be retrieved. During the various iterations of the exercises, the results from all models showed a substantial convergence, and the final data sets agreed for most cases within about 5{\%}. Larger deviations were found for cases with low atmospheric optical depth, for which the photon path lengths along the line of sight of the instrument can become very large. The differences occurred between models including full spherical geometry and those using only plane parallel approximation indicating that the correct treatment of the Earth's sphericity becomes indispensable. The modelled box-AMFs constitute an universal data base for the calculation of arbitrary ( total) AMFs by simple convolution with a given trace gas concentration profile. Together with the modelled radiances and the specified settings for the various exercises, they can serve as test cases for future RTM developments.},

abstract = {Objective: To quantify how the changing stillbirth risk profile of women is affecting the interpretation of the stillbirth rate. Design: A retrospective, population-based cohort study from 1983 to 2018. Setting: Victoria, Australia. Population: A total of 2 419 923 births at ≥28 weeks of gestation. Methods: Changes in maternal characteristics over time were assessed. A multivariable logistic regression model was developed for stillbirth, based on maternal characteristics in 1983–1987, and used to calculate individual predictive probabilities of stillbirth from the regression equation. The number of expected stillbirths per year as a result of the change in maternal demographics was then calculated, assuming no changes in care and in the associations between maternal characteristics and stillbirth over time. Main outcome measure: Stillbirth. Results: Compared with 1983–1987, there were more women in older age groups giving birth, more nulliparous women, more indigenous women and women born in Oceania, Asia and Africa, more multiple pregnancies and more women with pre-existing diabetes in 2014–2018. Despite this, the rate of stillbirth fell from 5.42 per 1000 births in 1983 to 1.72 per 1000 births in 2018 (P {\textless} 0.001). Applying the multivariable logistic regression equation, derived from the 1983–87 data, to each year, had there been no changes in care or in the associations between maternal characteristics and stillbirth, the rate of stillbirth would have increased by 12{\%}, from 4.94 per 1000 in 1983 to 5.54 per 1000 in 2018, as a result of the change in maternal characteristics. Conclusions: Population rates of stillbirth are falling faster than is generally appreciated.

This paper uses combustion efficiency as an independent variable for predicting emission factors for, among others, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, and particulate matter. Other gases are correlated with the release of carbon monoxide. The release of nitrogen and sulfur-based compounds occurs in relation to their content in the biomass. The Sundance Fire is used to model the emissions from major fires that have occurred in the United States. Approximately 1 Tg of biomass was consumed by this fire, which released 0.019, 0.151, 1.545, and 0.007 Tg of particulate matter, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen, respectively. Other fires have released over 50 times this amount. Global emissions of various products of combustion are dependent on the combustion efficiency of the fires. ?? 1991.},

abstract = {Two advanced optical techniques for the detection of alkali vapors in high-temperature gases are introduced in this Thesis. Alkali vapors are released in solid fuel combustion and increase the maintenance costs of the power plant boilers. Especially, biomass and waste are challenging fuels for contemporary technology. Alkali related problems are controlled with proper fuel mixture ratios and additives that are mixed to fuels or sprayed into the boiler. However, the controlling increases the cost of the produced energy and the additives increase SO2 concentration. In order to study the alkali formation mechanisms and to control alkali concentrations in power plant boilers, fast, accurate and highly sensitive detection techniques are needed. This Thesis presents the fundamental absorption properties of the K, KCl and KOH vapors, reviews previously applied techniques for the detection of alkalis, and intro- duces two novel detection methods. The first method is based on the Photoacoustic Spectroscopy (PAS), that utilizes two branches of physics, namely optics and acous- tics. A high-temperature PAS cell is introduced and applied to detect KCl and NaCl. Moreover, the possibility to apply the PAS cell to high-temperature salt-induced metal oxidation is discussed. The second method, which was fully developed during this work, is called Collinear Photofragmentation and Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (CPFAAS). CPFAAS pro- vides the limit of detection below parts per billion and the dynamic range of eight orders of magnitude in the detection of alkali chlorides. Moreover, the detection time of the CPFAAS measurement is in the order of micro second, which enables the diag- nostics of the fast changing processes, such as combustion. The technique is calibration free and is integrable to ”see-through” applications. In this Thesis, CPFAAS is ap- plied to determine potassium vapor concentrations from a laboratory cell, flue gases emanated from 10 mg fuel samples, and flue gases in intermediate and large scale com- bustion boilers. The presented applications, modeling and comparison with previously applied detection methods show that CPFAAS enables new detection and monitoring capabilities from corrosive high temperature gases.},

abstract = {Many relevant processes in tropospheric chemistry take place on rather small scales (e.g., tens to hundreds of meters) but often influence areas of several square kilometer. Thus, measurements of the involved trace gases with high spatial resolution are of great scientific interest. In order to identify individual sources and sinks and ultimately to improve chemical transport models, we developed a new airborne instrument, which is based on the well established Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) method. The Heidelberg Airborne Imaging DOAS Instrument (HAIDI) is a passive imaging DOAS spectrometer, which is capable of recording horizontal and vertical trace gas distributions with a resolution of better than 100 m. Observable species include NO2, HCHO, C2H2O2, H2O, O3, O4, SO2, IO, OClO and BrO.$\backslash$n Here we give a technical description of the instrument including its custom-built spectrographs and CCD detectors. Also first results from measurements with the new instrument are presented. These comprise spatial resolved SO2 and BrO in volcanic plumes, mapped at Mt. Etna (Sicily, Italy), NO2 emissions in the metropolitan area of Indianapolis (Indiana, USA) as well as BrO and NO2 distributions measured during arctic springtime in context of the BRomine, Ozone, and Mercury EXperiment (BROMEX) campaign, which was performed 2012 in Barrow (Alaska, USA).},

abstract = {In the UK stillbirth, describes the death of a baby before birth after 24 completed weeks of pregnancy. The rate has decreased in the UK over recent years but at a slower pace than other similar high-income countries. The association of certain risk factors (including maternal age, previous poor obstetric outcome, smoking and obesity) is clearly documented, though only a number of these factors can be modified. Use of interventions including the ‘Saving Babies Lives' Care Bundle focussing on smoking cessation, assessment for small for gestational age (SGA) babies, educating women regarding reduced fetal movements and effective fetal monitoring during labour aim to reduce both antenatal and intrapartum stillbirth. As yet, it remains difficult to predict which pregnancies are at greatest risk of stillbirth but with further research, ongoing improvements in antenatal and intrapartum care, and improved patient education, it is anticipated that the incidence in the UK can be substantially reduced.},

abstract = {Abstract. Fires are an important factor in shaping Earth's ecosystems. Plant and animal life, in almost every land habitat, are at least partially dependent on the effects of fire. However, their destructive force, which has often proven uncontrollable, is one of our greatest concerns, effectively resulting in several policies in the most important industrialised regions of the globe. This paper aims to comprehensively characterise the Forest Fire Finder (FFF), a forest fire detection system based mainly upon a spectroscopic technique called differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS). The system is designed and configured with the goal of detecting higher-than-the-horizon smoke columns by measuring and comparing scattered sunlight spectra. The article covers hardware and software, as well as their interactions and specific algorithms for day mode operation. An analysis of data retrieved from several installations deployed in the course of the last 5 years is also presented. Finally, this paper features a discussion on the most prominent future improvements planned for the system, as well as its ramifications and adaptations, such as a thermal imaging system for short-range fire seeking or environmental quality control.},

abstract = {An entirely different approach for tomographic imaging consists of assuming that the cross section consists of an array of unknowns, and then setting up algebraic equations for the unknowns in terms of the measured projection data. Although conceptually this approach is much simpler than the transform-based methods discussed in previous sections, for medical applications it lacks the accuracy and the speed of implementation. However, there are situations where it is not possible to measure a large number of projections, or the projections are not uniformly distributed over 180 or 360”) both these conditions being necessary requirements for the transformbased techniques to produce results with the accuracy desired in medical imaging. An example of such a situation is earth resources imaging using cross-borehole measurements discussed in Chapter 4. Problems of this type are sometimes more amenable to solution by algebraic techniques. Algebraic techniques are also useful when the energy propagation paths between the source and receiver positions are subject to ray bending on account of refraction, or when the energy propagation undergoes attenuation along ray paths as in emission CT. [Unfortunately, many imaging problems where refraction is encountered also suffer from diffraction effects (see Chap. 4).] As will be obvious from the discussion to follow, in algebraic methods it is essential to know ray paths that connect the corresponding transmitter and receiver positions. When refraction and diffraction effects are substantial (medium inhomogeneities exceed 10{\%} of the average background value and the correlation length of these inhomogeneities is comparable to a wavelength), it becomes impossible to predict these ray paths. If algebraic techniques are applied under these conditions, we often obtain meaningless results.},

Most previous studies quantifying wildland fire EF$\backslash$nof temperate ecosystems have focused on emissions from prescribed$\backslash$nburning conducted outside of the wildfire season. Little information is$\backslash$navailable on EF for wildfires in temperate forests of the conterminous$\backslash$nUS. The goal of this work is to provide information on emissions from$\backslash$nwildfire-season forest fires in the northern Rocky Mountains, US.$\backslash$nIn August 2011, we deployed airborne chemistry instruments and sampled$\backslash$nemissions over eight days from three wildfires and a prescribed fire$\backslash$nthat occurred in mixed conifer forests of the northern Rocky Mountains.$\backslash$nWe measured the combustion efficiency, quantified as the modified$\backslash$ncombustion efficiency (MCE), and EF for CO2, CO, and CH4. Our study$\backslash$naverage values for MCE, EFCO2, EFCO, and EFCH4 were 0.883, 1596 g$\backslash$nkg(-1), 135 g kg(-1), 7.30 g kg(-1), respectively. Compared with$\backslash$nprevious field studies of prescribed fires in temperate forests, the$\backslash$nfires sampled in our study had significantly lower MCE and EFCO2 and$\backslash$nsignificantly higher EFCO and EFCH4.$\backslash$nThe fires sampled in this study burned in areas reported to have$\backslash$nmoderate to heavy components of standing dead trees and down dead wood$\backslash$ndue to insect activity and previous fire, but fuel consumption data was$\backslash$nnot available. However, an analysis of MCE and fuel consumption data$\backslash$nfrom 18 prescribed fires reported in the literature indicates that the$\backslash$navailability of coarse fuels and conditions favorable for the combustion$\backslash$nof these fuels favors low MCE fires. This analysis suggests that fuel$\backslash$ncomposition was an important factor contributing to the low MCE of the$\backslash$nfires measured in this study.$\backslash$nThis study only measured EF for CO2, CO, and CH4; however, we used our$\backslash$nstudy average MCE to provide rough estimates of wildfire-season EF for$\backslash$nPM2.5 and four non-methane organic compounds (NMOC) using MCE and EF$\backslash$ndata reported in the literature. This analysis suggests the EFPM2.5 for$\backslash$nwildfires that occur in forests of the northern Rocky Mountains may be$\backslash$nsignificantly larger than those reported for temperate forests in the$\backslash$nliterature and that used in a recent national emission inventory. If the$\backslash$nMCE of the fires sampled in this work are representative of the$\backslash$ncombustion characteristics of wildfire-season fires in similar forest$\backslash$ntypes across the western US then the use of EF based on prescribed fires$\backslash$nmay result in an underestimate of wildfire PM2.5 and NMOC emissions.$\backslash$nGiven the magnitude of biomass consumed by western US wildfires, this$\backslash$nmay have important implications for the forecasting and management of$\backslash$nregional air quality.},

We examine the numerous potentialities of minor gas slant column calculations, applying the "off-axis" methodology for collecting the diffuse solar radiation. One of these particular approaches, using measurements along horizontal paths, has already been tested with the spectrometer installed on board the Geophysica aircraft during stratospheric flights up to altitudes of 20 km. The theoretical basis of these new measurement techniques using DOAS remote sensing systems are delineated to assess whether low altitude flights can provide 2D and 3D pollution tomography over metropolitan areas. The 2D or 3D trace gas total column mapping could be used to investigate: i) transport and dispersion phenomena of air pollution, ii) photochemical process rates, iii) gas plume tomography, iv) minor gas vertical profiles into the Planetary Boundary Layer and v) minor gas flux divergence over a large area.},

Having a stillborn baby has a wide range of consequences that can affect parents, family and the healthcare professionals involved. Several risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of stillbirth: including maternal medical factors, maternal characteristics, fetal factors, sociodemographic factors and behavioral factors. The aim of this work is to review the literature on risk factors that have a behavioral component. The main behaviors modulating the risk of stillbirth that have been more widely studied in the literature include use of substances (smoking, alcohol, illicit drugs and medical drugs), weight management, attendance at antenatal care and sleeping position. There is evidence in the literature that supports that all those behaviors have an impact on the risk of stillbirth, especially in the cases of smoking and drugs consumption during the pregnancy. Hence, more research is needed to establish interventions targeting these behaviors as preventive measures to reduce the risk of adverse obstetric outcomes.},

abstract = {A healthy pregnancy depends on complex interrelated biological adaptations involving placentation, maternal immune responses, and hormonal homeostasis. Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have provided access to multiomics biological data that, combined with clinical and social data, can provide a deeper understanding of normal and abnormal pregnancies. Integration of these heterogeneous datasets using state-of-the-art machine-learning methods can enable the prediction of short- and long-term health trajectories for a mother and offspring and the development of treatments to prevent or minimize complications. We review advanced machine-learning methods that could: provide deeper biological insights into a pregnancy not yet unveiled by current methodologies; clarify the etiologies and heterogeneity of pathologies that affect a pregnancy; and suggest the best approaches to address disparities in outcomes affecting vulnerable populations.},

@article{Wang2014,
abstract = {We apply a novel experimental procedure for the rapid measurement of the average volume mixing ratios (VMRs) and horizontal distributions of trace gases such as NO2, SO2, and HCHO in the boundary layer, which was recently suggested by Sinreich et al. (2013). The method is based on two-dimensional scanning multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS). It makes use of two facts (Sinreich et al., 2013): first, the light path for observations at 1° elevation angle traverses mainly air masses located close to the ground (typically 4. Thus, the average value of the trace gas VMR in the atmospheric layer between the surface and the particular altitude, for which this observation was sensitive, can be calculated. Compared to the originally proposed method, we introduce several important modifications and improvements: We apply the method only to measurements at 1° elevation angle (besides zenith view), for which the uncertainties of the retrieved values of the VMRs and surface extinctions are especially small. Using only 1° elevation angle for off-axis observation also allows an increased temporal resolution. We determine (and apply) correction factors (and their uncertainties) directly as function of the measured O4 absorption. Finally, the method is extended to trace gases analysed at other wavelengths and also to the retrieval of aerosol extinction. Depending on atmospheric visibility, the typical uncertainty of the results ranges from about 20{\%} to 30{\%}. We apply the rapid method to observations of a newly-developed ground-based multifunctional passive differential optical absorption spectroscopy (GM-DOAS) instrument in the north-west outskirts near Hefei in China. We report NO2, SO2, and HCHO VMRs and aerosol extinction for four azimuth angles and compare these results with those from simultaneous long-path DOAS observations. Good agreement is found (squares of the correlation coefficients for NO2, SO2, and HCHO were 0.92, 0.85, and 0.60, respectively), verifying the reliability of this novel method. Similar agreement is found for the comparison of the aerosol extinction with results from visibility meters. Future studies may conduct measurements using a larger number of azimuth angles to increase the spatial resolution.},

@article{Schonhardt2015,
abstract = {For the purpose of trace gas measurements and pollution mapping, the Airborne imaging DOAS instrument for Measurements of Atmospheric Pollution (AirMAP) has been developed, characterised and successfully operated from aircraft. From the observations with the AirMAP instrument nitrogen dioxide (NO2) columns were retrieved.  A major benefit of the pushbroom imaging instrument is the spatially continuous, gap-free measurement sequence independent of flight altitude, a valuable characteristic for mapping purposes. This is made possible by the use of a frame-transfer detector. With a wide-angle entrance objective, a broad field-of-view across track of around 48° is achieved, leading to a swath width of about the same size as the flight altitude. The use of fibre coupled light intake optics with sorted light fibres allows flexible positioning within the aircraft and retains the very good imaging capabilities.$\backslash$n The measurements yield ground spatial resolutions below 100 m. From a maximum of 35 individual viewing directions (lines of sight, LOS) represented by 35 single fibres, the number of viewing directions is adapted to each situation by averaging according to signal-to-noise or spatial resolution requirements.  Exploitation of all the viewing directions yields observations at 30 m spatial resolution, making the instrument a suitable tool for mapping trace gas point sources and small scale variability.  For accurate spatial mapping the position and aircraft attitude are taken into account using the Attitude and Heading Reference System of the aircraft.$\backslash$n A first demonstration mission using AirMAP was undertaken. In June 2011, AirMAP has been operated on the AWI Polar-5 aircraft in the framework of the AIRMETH2011 campaign. During a flight above a medium sized coal-fired power plant in North-West Germany, AirMAP clearly detects the emission plume downwind from the exhaust stack, with NO2 vertical columns around 2 × 1016 molecules cm−2 in the plume center. The emission estimates are consistent with reports in the pollutant transfer register. Strong spatial gradients and variability in NO2 amounts across and along flight direction are observed, and small-scale enhancements of NO2 above a motorway are detected. The present study reports on the experimental setup and characteristics of AirMAP, and the first measurements at high spatial resolution and wide spatial coverage are presented which meet the requirements for NO2 mapping to observe and account for the intrinsic variability of tropospheric NO2.},

Traditional approaches cope with graphi-cal data structures using a preprocessing phase which transforms the graphs into a set of flat vectors. However, in this way, important topological information may be lost and the achieved results may heavily depend on the preprocessing stage. This paper presents a new neural model, called graph neural network (GNN), capable of directly processing graphs. GNNs extends recursive neural networks and can be applied on most of the practically useful kinds of graphs, including directed, undirected, labelled and cyclic graphs. A learning algorithm for GNNs is proposed and some experiments are discussed which assess the properties of the model.},

abstract = {Atmospheric observations of the O4 absorption bands at 360.5, 380.2, 477.3, 532.2, 577.2 and 630.0 nm are presented for different atmospheric conditions (clear and cloudy skies) and viewing geometries (direct and zenith-scattered light observations). From the observations of direct moonlight it was possible to derive absolute O4 absorption cross sections for atmospheric conditions. We found that the relative shape of the observed absorption bands is similar to those of the O4 spectrum measured by Greenblatt et al. [1990] in the laboratory. However, in general (except for the absorption band at 380.2 nm), the O4 absorption cross sections derived in this study are larger by several percent compared to those of the other (mainly laboratory) observations. Using the observations of zenith-scattered light, we investigated the radiative transport through the atmosphere. Our observations under cloudy sky conditions confirmed that the light path enhancement due to multiple Mie scattering on cloud droplets is independent of wavelength. From the observations under clear-sky conditions we studied the influence of Mie scattering on aerosol. It was not possible to describe the selected clear-sky measurements by taking into account only Rayleigh scattering. We found that the comparison of the O4 measurements with model results for different sets of assumed aerosol extinctions provides a new, very sensitive tool to derive aerosol parameters from zenith sky ground-based measurements.},

abstract = {Preterm births affect around 15 million children a year worldwide. Current medical efforts focus on mitigating the effects of prematurity, not on preventing it. Diagnostic methods are based on parent traits and transvaginal ultrasound, during which the length of the cervix is examined. Approximately 30{\%} of preterm births are not correctly predicted due to the complexity of this process and its subjective assessment. Based on recent research, there is hope that machine learning can be a helpful tool to support the diagnosis of preterm births. The objective of this study is to present various machine learning algorithms applied to preterm birth prediction. The wide spectrum of analysed data sets is the advantage of this survey. They range from electrohysterogram signals through electronic health records to transvaginal ultrasounds. Reviews of works on preterm birth already exist; however, this is the first review that includes works that are based on a transvaginal ultrasound examination. In this work, we present a critical appraisal of popular methods that have employed machine learning methods for preterm birth prediction. Moreover, we summarise the most common challenges incurred and discuss their possible application in the future.},
