\subsection{The \gls{UAV}}%
\label{sub:results_drone}

The component list presented in Table~\ref{tab:results_drone_components}
follows the drone concept explained in Section~\ref{sub:methods_uav}.
The idea was to build a hexacopter based on the very flexible and
commonly used DJI S900 frame. This drone had to be capable of
maintaining flight for at least 30 minutes while carrying a payload of
2kg (which is actually more than the collection system weighs). Note the
inclusion of custom-made carbon fibre arms and 17" propellers.
