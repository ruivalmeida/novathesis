In Chapter~\ref{cha:methods}, I introduced the methods with which I
conducted the research and work in this thesis. In addition, I also
introduced the notion that this project is divided naturally in two main
parts, according to the research questions that I aim to answer.

This chapter maintains this division. In Section~\ref{sec:results_hyp1},
I present and discuss what has come from the work conducted with
reference to the technological problem of obtaining sufficient
tomographic data for the retrieval of an atmospheric trace gas column
density map for a given geographic area, through optical spectroscopy
techniques.

Section~\ref{sec:results_hyp2} is, naturally, dedicated to the results
coming from the second hypothesis presented in
Chapter~\ref{cha:methods}. This is to say the \emph{Lambertian}
hypothesis that was tested through a practical experiment designed
especially to this end.
