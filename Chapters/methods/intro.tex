Macroscopically, the approach to the \gls{RQ} was conducted by working
with two hypothesis:
\begin{description}
    \item[First Hypothesis:] The definition of a particular set of
        algorithmically defined projections in such a manner that they
        might be used for tomographic reconstruction of column densities
        of trace gases in the atmosphere, in a given \gls{ROI};
    \item[Second Hypothesis:] We can retrieve the column density for a
        given trace gas (or set of trace gases) between two points by
        performing a spectral measurement in both of these points in the
        same direction and subtracting them one from the other.
\end{description}

To test the first hypothesis, I have used a number of computational
methods to define and create projection and backprojection matrix
operators, resulting in a dedicated simulation software tool that proves
without a doubt that the devised projection gathering strategy is able
to produce projection information in sufficient quantity as to perform
tomographic reconstruction. This procedure is detailed in
Section~\ref{sec:tomosim}. 

The second hypothesis was experimentally tested, by the conduction of a
number of field experiments designed to determine the validity of
measurement hypothesis with the equipments to which I have current
access. The experiment and the protocol that was followed is detailed in
Section~\ref{sec:the_experiment}. This chapter is heavily based on one
of the two articles generated by the work of this thesis.
