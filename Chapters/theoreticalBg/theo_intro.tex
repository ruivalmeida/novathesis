In the development of this thesis, I had to become familiar with several
subjects, both in terms of required instrumentation and theoretical
concepts.

For designing a drone based system, I had to deal with the various
components that make up the vehicle itself. Designing the optical system
required me to understand telescopes and spectrometers (at least from
the user's point of view). Performing a tomographic inversion demanded a
basic comprehension of the mathematical process behind it and how to
reproduce it computationally. Finally, the spectroscopic aspect of this
thesis needed quite a firm grasp on the \gls{DOAS} technique. 

This section aims to describe these topics, up to the level I needed to
reach to complete the work.
