\section{Optical Systems}%
\label{sec:theobg_opticalsystems}

Optical systems are, as far as this thesis is concerned, light capturing
and digitising systems. Their purpose is to gather light from the
environment at certain conditions and format it into data that one can
analyse computationally and a general schematic representation is
presented in Figure~\ref{fig:theobg_opticalsystems_generalschematic}.
In this section, I will present the basic theoretical concepts on which
I stood to design the optical system, as it is presented in the
following chapters.
