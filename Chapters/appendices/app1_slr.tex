\chapter{Systematic Review of DOAS Tomography}
\label{ap:tomDoas}

The following is a review article written as a requirement for
completion of a course on Advanced Software Development, as part of the
curricular segment of my PhD. The article was submitted to Elsevier
Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment, having been
rejected on the grounds of featuring an insufficient number of articles
and excluded important papers, namely some written in Japanese and
Russian, according to the reviewers. I have discussed with the other
authors the possibility of resubmission to a different journal, but have
not yet been able to do this.
