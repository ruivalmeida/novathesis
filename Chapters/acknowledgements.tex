First and foremost, I need to thank FCT NOVA and FutureCompta, for
having me and letting me work with them and develop this thesis. In
addition, I want to acknowledge the contribution from the Portugues
Foundation for Science and Technology, who funded this work through the
NOVA I4H doctoral programme, grant PDE/BDE/114549/2016.

I would also like to thank my advisor, Prof. Pedro Vieira, for all the
support he has given me, on many levels and throughout the years.

To my friends, old and new, I extend my utmost gratitude for helping me
tilt my head back and laugh once in a while.

Finally, to my family, without whom I would have never been able to do
anything, much less something as significant as what I present in this
dissertation.
