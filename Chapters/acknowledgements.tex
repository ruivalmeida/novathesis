% I am writing these lines sometime in 2019. It is hard to contemplate
% that almost 4 years have come and gone since I started this gigantic
% endeavor. It took a lot of work (and will still take a lot more because
% I am not done writing it!), a lot of dedication, patience and
% perseverance, but it is finally done. Here is my PhD thesis, the
% culmination of my work for the past 4 years. I hope anyone who is
% reading enjoys doing so, or if not, I hope that at least s/he finds what
% s/he was looking for.

% I call it my work, and indeed it is, but I find it difficult to believe
% that I would be able to do it without the help of the people and
% institutions I acknowledge in this section. Know that I am deeply
% grateful, and will forever remain so.

% To my Alma Mater, FCT NOVA. So many things I hate about it, so many
% things I would change. I think it's almost a Portuguese trademark to
% hate the things we love the most. It is a second home and I truthfully
% hope this has not been the last they have seen of me.

% To Compta, who have accepted me in their ranks without knowing anything
% whatsoever about me, but knowing that I would not be able to give as
% much of me as the other workers, at least during my work as a PhD
% student.

% To my adviser, which has been with me since the time of my Masters, and
% to whom I owe many of the opportunities I have been granted throughout
% the almost 8 years in which we have worked together. Not only that, but
% he has also had my back when the time came that I was not able to.



% The acknowledgements. You are free to write this section at your own will.  However, usually it starts with the institutional acknowledgements (adviser, institution, grants, workmates, \ldots) and then comes the personal acknowledgements (friends, family, \ldots).
